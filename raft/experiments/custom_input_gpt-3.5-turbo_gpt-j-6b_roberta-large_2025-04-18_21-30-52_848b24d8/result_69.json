    "original": "Phishing is a complex cybercrime involving the theft of personal information through deceptive websites posing as legitimate sources. In this study, we present a method for identifying phishing URLs by carefully selecting lexical features that are resistant to common obfuscation techniques employed by attackers. By evaluating the classification accuracy of lexical features, both automatically and hand-selected, we demonstrate their sufficiency for practical purposes. Additionally, we compare various classification algorithms and recommend the use of an online method (AROW) capable of handling noisy training data. Leveraging these insights, we introduce PhishDef, a phishing detection system utilizing only URL names and integrating the aforementioned elements. PhishDef stands out as a highly accurate, lightweight solution suitable for online deployment, proactive in its online classification approach, and resilient to inaccuracies in training data, thus enabling the utilization of large, noisy datasets.",
