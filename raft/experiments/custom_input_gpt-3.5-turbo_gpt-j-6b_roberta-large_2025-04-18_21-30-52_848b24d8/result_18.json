    "original": "This study introduces an innovative technique for estimating crop primary productivity through machine learning methods trained with radiative transfer simulations. By merging data collected from Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 satellites, our research aims to enhance the precision of primary productivity estimation. We utilize radiative transfer simulations to develop training datasets, which are inputted into machine learning algorithms for primary productivity predictions. Various machine learning models, including random forests, support vector machines, and deep neural networks, are explored and evaluated based on metrics such as coefficient of determination and root mean squared error to assess their performance. Our findings reveal that our methodology generates precise estimates of primary productivity, surpassing conventional techniques. Furthermore, the integration of data from Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 satellites results in improved accuracy. This research holds promising implications for precision agriculture and crop management by offering high-resolution primary productivity estimates on a global scale.",
