    "original": "The exploration of mutual entropy and capacity in classical systems post-Shannon has been prominent in the works of various authors like Kolmogorov and Gelfand. In the realm of quantum systems, different definitions of mutual entropy for classical input and quantum output have been proposed. The introduction of the fully quantum mechanical mutual entropy in 1983, based on Umegaki's relative entropy, has been instrumental in quantifying the capacity of quantum channels for communication processes involving quantum inputs and outputs. The significance of correlated states, such as quantum entangled states, in quantum information processing, including quantum computation, teleportation, and cryptography, has been recognized. This paper delves into three main aspects: highlighting the distinction between the capacity of quantum channels and classical-quantum-classical channels, proposing a broader definition and classification of entangled states, and exploring quantum mutual entropy for entangled states. The latter two aspects are a collaborative endeavor with Belavkin.",
