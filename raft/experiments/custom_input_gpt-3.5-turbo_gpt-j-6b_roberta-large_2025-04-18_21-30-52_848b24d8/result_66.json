    "original": "This study introduces a new strategy for deriving causal inferences through instrumental variables, diverging from conventional methods that heavily rely on stringent assumptions and can result in bias when these assumptions are violated. Grounded in randomization inference, the proposed strategy offers greater robustness against underlying assumption violations by circumventing rigid modeling guidelines. Demonstrating consistency even in scenarios with an abundance of instruments, the approach showcases commendable performance in finite samples. A simulation analysis reveals that the novel method exhibits reduced bias and minimized mean-squared error compared to traditional approaches. Applicably, the effectiveness of the strategy is highlighted through an empirical investigation on educational outcomes, where randomization inference is utilized to estimate the causal impact of class size on test scores. Collectively, the findings underscore randomization inference as a promising avenue for deriving causal inferences using instrumental variables.",
