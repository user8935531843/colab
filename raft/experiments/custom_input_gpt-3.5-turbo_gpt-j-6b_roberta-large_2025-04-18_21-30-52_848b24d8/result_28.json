    "original": "Holomorphic matrix models serve as a specialized mathematical framework utilized in the examination of quantum field theories. Distinguished by the holomorphic characteristics of their matrix variables, these models adhere to specific analytic properties, rendering them valuable tools in theoretical physics and the exploration of two-dimensional string theories. Holomorphic matrix models stand out for their ability to address complex problems, particularly those associated with non-perturbative effects in string theory, that are challenging to tackle using conventional methods. These models have also found utility in investigating matrix quantum mechanics, random matrix theory, and integrable systems. Despite their significance, there exist numerous unresolved inquiries concerning holomorphic matrix models, including the precise relationship between these models and topological string theory. This paper aims to provide an exhaustive overview of the current research landscape surrounding holomorphic matrix models, delving into recent advancements, future prospects, and key unresolved issues within this domain.",
