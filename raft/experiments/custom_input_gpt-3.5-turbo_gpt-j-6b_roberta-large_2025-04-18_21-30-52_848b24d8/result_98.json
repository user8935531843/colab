    "original": "This study introduces a novel method for segmenting human entities and determining their velocities by leveraging machine learning techniques and annotated LiDAR data. By training a deep neural network on a comprehensive dataset of labeled LiDAR sequences, the proposed approach extracts robust features associated with human presence and motion. Results indicate that accurate human segmentation can be achieved, even within challenging scenarios like crowded or obstructed environments. Furthermore, a methodology is presented for estimating the velocities of segmented humans using temporal information from the same LiDAR sequences. By leveraging temporal context to predict future human positions, the proposed approach enables precise velocity estimation. Comparative analysis demonstrates superior performance in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency compared to existing methods. The implications of this technique span across fields like human-robot interaction, autonomous driving, and surveillance systems. By enhancing robots' ability to perceive and engage with humans in complex settings, the approach contributes towards improved safety and operational efficiency. Anticipated benefits also extend to the advancement of self-driving vehicle technology, where precise pedestrian velocity estimation is critical for ensuring secure navigation.",
