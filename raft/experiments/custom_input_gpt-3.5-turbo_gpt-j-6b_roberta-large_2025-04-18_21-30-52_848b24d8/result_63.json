    "original": "Recent research has demonstrated that by sharing the parts of a bipartite quantum state, Bell nonlocality can be activated, leading to enhanced noise tolerance boundaries for device-independent entanglement verification. Building upon these findings, this study further investigates this phenomenon and uncovers additional insights. New results pertaining to the activation of Bell nonlocality are established, including the crafting of Bell inequalities tailored to the broadcast scenario and the introduction of enhanced notions of Bell nonlocality activation through broadcasting. This study showcases that bipartite states admitting a local hidden-variable model for general measurements can result in genuine tripartite nonlocal correlations. Additionally, device-independent entanglement certification in the broadcast scenario is explored, with semidefinite programming techniques demonstrating its feasibility for the two-qubit Werner state across a wide range of entanglement levels. Furthermore, the concept of EPR steering is extended to the broadcast scenario, with novel examples highlighting the activation of the two-qubit isotropic state. These findings lay the groundwork for broadcast-based device-dependent and semi-device-independent protocols.",
