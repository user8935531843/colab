    "original": "This paper introduces a linear Vlasov solver that accurately evaluates the microbunching gain while considering the impacts of Coherent Synchrotron Radiation (CSR), Longitudinal Space Charge (LSC), and linear accelerator geometric impedances. Microbunching, which results in periodic density modulations within an electron beam, is a phenomenon utilized to enhance the performance of radiation sources like Free Electron Lasers (FELs). Precise estimation of microbunching gain is essential for optimizing the operation of such radiation sources. Our solver utilizes a robust matrix-based approach to efficiently compute the microbunching gain based on beam parameters and machine lattice configuration. Validation of our solver is demonstrated through comparisons with particle tracking simulations and experiments conducted at the Linac Coherent Light Source-II (LCLS-II) at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory. Results indicate strong agreement between our solver's outputs and simulation and experimental data across a broad spectrum of machine and beam conditions. The presented solver marks a significant advancement towards enhancing our understanding of microbunching gain and its optimization for FELs and related radiation sources.",
