    "original": "A detailed analysis is presented on the baryon electromagnetic and axial form factors derived from relativistic constituent quark models within the framework of Poincaré-invariant quantum mechanics, with a primary focus on the point-form approach. Initially, the study outlines the projections of the Goldstone-boson-exchange constituent quark model on the electroweak structure of nucleons, utilizing a spectator-model current in point form. Subsequently, the discussion delves into the impact of diverse dynamics inherent in different constituent quark models (Goldstone-boson-exchange, one-gluon-exchange, instanton-induced interactions). Comparisons between results obtained in point form and instant form are made, revealing considerable relativistic effects. Notably, nonrelativistic approaches are dismissed, while instant-form predictions exhibit significant deficiencies. The spectator-model approximation for the current highlights the viability of point-form outcomes as the most plausible a priori choice. Encompassed within these findings are notably accurate descriptions and agreement with experimental data for all elastic electroweak observables, particularly in the context of the Goldstone-boson-exchange constituent quark model.",
