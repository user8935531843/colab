    "original": "The Computational physics research community has recently directed its focus towards accelerating electronic structure calculations, particularly within the context of the full-potential linearized augmented plane-wave (FLAPW) method on diverse computing architectures. By harnessing the power of Graphical Processing Units (GPUs) and employing parallelization techniques like the Message Passing Interface (MPI) and OpenMP, we have significantly reduced the computational time required for FLAPW calculations. This optimization has transformed the method from a days-long process to one that can be completed within hours, rendering it more feasible for large-scale systems and extended simulations. Our hybrid parallelization strategy, integrating both MPI and OpenMP, has yielded substantial speed enhancements, allowing for efficient utilization of a high number of processors. Through benchmarking tests and a thorough examination of code execution times, we have gained valuable insights into the effectiveness of our optimization methods. The ability to accelerate the FLAPW method on heterogeneous architectures not only showcases advancements in computational physics but also holds immense value for materials science researchers seeking to delve deep into materials analysis and property prediction through electronic structure computations.",
