    "original": "The brain's network structure serves as a foundational element in comprehending brain function, with the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster providing a model for analysis. Through synchrotron-radiation tomographic microscopy, a three-dimensional examination of the fly's brain network was conducted, resulting in the creation of a wire model depicting the distribution of X-ray absorption coefficients. The model revealed various neuronal processes, segmented into groups based on their distinct three-dimensional structures. These groups identified long-range projections and repeated structures within the optic lobe. Additionally, the model included neuronal processes that did not align with known classifications, indicating their potential significance in brain functions. The study underscores the importance of unclassified neurons in brain network functionality, offering a quantitative insight into the structural organization of the Drosophila brain. Future endeavors aim to refine the methodology for reconstructing the brain network at a higher resolution to enhance our understanding of brain structure.",
