    "original": "The advancement in brain network architecture analysis has illustrated the dynamic nature of functional networks, emphasizing the importance of accounting for non-stationarity in fMRI data. The Smooth Incremental Graphical Lasso Estimation (SINGLE) algorithm emerges as a novel solution to estimate dynamic brain networks from fMRI data. Its application to functional MRI data from healthy patients engaging in a choice-response task reveals the fluctuating network structures associated with attention-demanding cognitive tasks. Graph theoretic analyses highlight the dynamic nature of the Right Inferior Frontal Gyrus, a region known to be vital for cognitive control, as it adapts during cognitive tasks. These findings suggest the critical role of the Right Inferior Frontal Gyrus in attention and executive function during cognitive challenges, as well as its potential involvement in regulating interactions among other brain regions.",
