    "original": "The Minimum-Recombinant Haplotype Configuration problem (MRHC) has been instrumental in addressing genotype phasing in pedigrees through a solid combinatorial framework. Although existing algorithmic enhancements have yielded efficient solutions, the MRHC formulation falls short in reflecting key characteristics of real genomic data, such as mutations, genotyping errors, and missing data. Introducing the Haplotype Configuration with Recombinations and Errors problem (HCRE), this study broadens the original MRHC formulation to incorporate prevalent real-world data characteristics, including errors and missing genotypes. Despite the computational complexity of HCRE, an exact algorithm is proposed based on a reduction to the Satisfiability problem, leveraging advancements in constraint programming and state-of-the-art SAT solvers. Experimental evidence showcases the model's biological accuracy and the algorithm's efficacy in terms of accuracy and performance across various simulated scenarios and a case study involving a real dairy cattle population.",
