    "original": "In recent years, the fields of Natural Language Processing (NLP), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Machine Learning (ML) have gained significant traction, prompting the availability of online resources and courses accessible to individuals with varying levels of expertise. Amidst this abundance of information, individuals may find themselves unsure of where to commence their studies on a particular topic. To address this issue, we utilize an embedding-based method to determine the foundational knowledge required for comprehending course concepts in the realm of NLP. To aid in this endeavor, we introduce LectureBank, a dataset comprised of 1,352 English lecture files sourced from university courses, each categorized according to an established taxonomy. Furthermore, the dataset includes 208 manually labeled topics representing prerequisite relations, serving as a valuable educational resource for tasks like lecture organization and preparation, as well as facilitating reading list creation. Furthermore, we explore the use of neural graph-based networks and non-neural classifiers to leverage the dataset for learning the prerequisite relations effectively.",
