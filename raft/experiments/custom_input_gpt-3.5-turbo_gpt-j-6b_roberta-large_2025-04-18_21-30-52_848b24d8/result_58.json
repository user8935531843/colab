    "original": "The Schwinger model is a widely utilized framework for testing theoretical and numerical methods in lattice field theory, with unexplored physical properties in anisotropic volumes. In the context of the multi-flavor finite temperature Schwinger model, an approximate solution by Hosotani et al. based on bosonization is available. Through lattice simulations, we assess the accuracy of this approximation for two flavors before transitioning to the $\\delta$-regime by swapping the role of coordinates. At zero temperature, we investigate the link between the residual \"pion\" mass and spatial size. Our findings reveal the universality of features derived by Leutwyler, Hasenfratz, and Niedermayer regarding quasi-spontaneous symmetry breaking from $d>2$, extending to $d=2$. This permits the calculation of the Schwinger model equivalent of the pion decay constant $F_{\\pi}$, aligning with results from Harada et al. and analytical deductions from 2d versions of the Witten–Veneziano formula and the Gell-Mann–Oakes–Renner relation, indicating $F_{\\pi} = 1/ \\sqrt{2\\pi}$.",
