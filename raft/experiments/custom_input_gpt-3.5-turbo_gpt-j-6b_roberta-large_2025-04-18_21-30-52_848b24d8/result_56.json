    "original": "Our study focuses on left-right symmetric extensions of the standard model, utilizing open strings terminating on D-branes to incorporate gauge bosons and chiral matter. Gauge bosons stem from strings connected to stacks of D-branes, while chiral matter arises from strings stretching between intersecting D-branes. The fermions exhibit Sp(1)_L and Sp(1)_R symmetries, necessitating the introduction of Higgs fields in a bi-fundamental (2,2) representation to generate their masses. Left-right symmetry is disrupted by Higgs fields in the doublet representation of Sp(1)_R, leading to the suppression of Majorana mass terms at higher energy scales. Neutrinos combine as Dirac fermions, influencing the decay widths of the right-handed W' boson across dilepton and dijets channels. Examination of the (g_R, m_{W'}) parameter space against the latest LHC13 Run II results from 2016 data reveals that gauge bosons with masses m_{W'} \\agt 3.5~{\\rm TeV} remain unexcluded. With the LHC embarking on TeV-scale investigations, substantial opportunities for W' discovery persist.",
