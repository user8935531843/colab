    "original": "Utilizing high-resolution long-slit spectroscopy, we conducted a study on the ionized gas within the active galaxy IRAS 04210+0400 and its correlation with the radio structure. Our findings indicate that two ionized components are linked to the central double radio source, with varying relative positions observed across different emission lines. These observations align with the hypothesis that the radio components correspond to the active surfaces of twin jets emanating from the galaxy's center. In this context, optical emission at the center is believed to originate behind bow shocks generated by the jets in the interstellar medium. Emission lines display a significant velocity spread (~900 km/s) at the hotspots of the radio lobes, suggesting a model in which a jet head emerges through the interface between the interstellar and intergalactic medium. This phenomenon parallels prior models proposed for explaining wide-angle tail radio sources (WAT's). Through a simulated long-slit spectrum, we validate our model against observational data.",
