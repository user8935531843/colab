    "original": "This research introduces a novel technique to segment coherent motion in videos captured through moving cameras by utilizing optical flow orientations. The method incorporates factors like camera ego-motion and scene 3D structure to accurately estimate optical flow orientations. By constructing coherence matrices for local patches in the video, showcasing primary motion directions and magnitudes, the proposed approach utilizes a graph-based segmentation algorithm to delineate coherent motion regions. Demonstrating superior performance compared to existing methods in terms of precision and efficiency, the method is resilient towards camera vibrations and lighting variations. Additionally, its real-time application potential adds to its practical utility. Validation through experiments conducted on synthetic and real-world datasets, inclusive of complex scenarios like densely populated scenes with multiple coherent motion regions, substantiates the approach's efficacy. This work serves to propel advancements in the realm of computer vision, presenting substantial applications across domains like autonomous driving, scene comprehension, and surveillance systems.",
