    "original": "This study introduces a novel methodology known as perturb-max for statistical inference in high-dimensional settings, combining random perturbations with optimization techniques. By introducing randomness into maximum a-posteriori (MAP) predictions through random perturbation of input potential functions, this methodology leverages extreme value statistics to generate unbiased samples from the Gibbs distribution using high-dimensional perturbations. While the computational load of generating numerous high-dimensional random variables may be high, the efficiency of perturb-max prediction sampling is comparable to MAP optimization when low-dimensional perturbations are used. Notably, the study demonstrates that the anticipated value of perturb-max inference with low-dimensional perturbations can be employed sequentially to derive unbiased samples from the Gibbs distribution. Additionally, the anticipated value of maximal perturbations acts as a natural limit on the entropy of perturb-max models, with a measure concentration outcome indicating that the discrepancy between sampled averages and expectations diminishes exponentially with the number of samples, facilitating accurate approximations of expectations.",
