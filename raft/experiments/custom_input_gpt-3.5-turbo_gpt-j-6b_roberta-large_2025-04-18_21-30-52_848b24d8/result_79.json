    "original": "Our study focuses on European VLBI Network UHF band spectral line observations aimed at pinpointing the redshifted 21cm HI absorption evident in the compact steep spectrum galaxies 3C 49 and 3C 268.3. The detection of HI absorption in the western radio lobe of 3C 49 and the northern lobe of 3C 268.3 suggests the potential presence of HI in the opposing fainter lobes as well. The brighter and closer radio lobes exhibiting HI absorption are depolarized and exhibit optical emission line gas, indicating a correlation between HI absorption and emission line gas concentrated in atomic cores. This association supports the theory that the HI absorption originates within the atomic cores of emission line clouds. Our findings align with a scenario where compact steep spectrum sources interact with dense gas clouds in their host galaxies, potentially leading to asymmetries in radio and optical emissions due to interactions with an asymmetric distribution of dense clouds in their environment.",
