    "original": "The discussion on the internal structure of stars or interstellar clouds within the realms of classical and relativistic physics has been a subject of profound interest. Particularly, the application of General Relativity principles to this scenario has been extensively explored in various research papers. This study delves into a prototype model within the context of General Relativity, assuming a star comprises polytropic gas. Notably, stars undergo irreversible thermodynamic processes and emit energy to their surroundings, prompting the consideration of a simplified polytropic gas model. By formulating a single equation governing the cumulative mass distribution of the star and utilizing the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation, we derive expressions for the isentropic index and coefficient. Analytical and numerical solutions are provided for the polytropic structure of self-gravitating stars, with a focus on examining their stability. Moreover, it is established that the knowledge of a star's thermodynamics through the isentropic index and coefficient uniquely determines the internal matter density within the star.",
