    "original": "Conversational machine reading systems serve the purpose of aiding users in addressing complex questions, such as determining eligibility for specific government benefits, when the exact rules governing these determinations are unclear. These rules are typically outlined in procedural text, such as guidelines from government websites, which the system must interpret in order to generate relevant questions for the user. An innovative conversational machine reading model, the Entailment-driven Extract and Edit network (E3), is introduced to extract decision rules from procedural text while simultaneously considering which rules are entailed by the conversation history and which require further refinement. E3 demonstrates superior performance on the ShARC conversational machine reading dataset, surpassing existing systems and a new BERT-based baseline. By explicitly identifying the information still needed for decision-making, E3 offers a more interpretable solution compared to previous approaches. The source code for E3 models and experiments is openly available at https://github.com/vzhong/e3.",
