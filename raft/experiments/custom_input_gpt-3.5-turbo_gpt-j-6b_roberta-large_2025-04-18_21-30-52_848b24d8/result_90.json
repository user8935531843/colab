    "original": "Simulating magnetization reversal in a fine ferromagnetic grain involves considering various factors such as exchange interaction, uniaxial anisotropy, Zeeman energy, and dipole-dipole interactions. The process involves discretizing a cubic grain into multiple subgrains and solving the gyromagnetic equations of motion without damping. A unique scheme is developed to solve these equations, conserving the absolute magnitude using only two variables per sub-cube magnetization. Initially, there is a uniform rotation followed by nonlinear magnetic oscillations driven by a uniform mode, converting excess initial Zeeman energy into nonlinear spin waves that facilitate significant magnetization reversal. This reversal process in fine quasi-single-domain grains showcases characteristics typical of Hamiltonian wave systems with nonlinear diffusion, a phenomenon that is restricted in the presence of a strong reversal field and/or small grain size.",
