    "original": "This study explores the effects of AGN feedback simulations on gas fractions and the Lx-T scaling relation in galaxy clusters and groups. Utilizing advanced hydrodynamical simulations integrating AGN feedback, star formation, and gas cooling, the research highlights the significant impact of AGN feedback in regulating gas fractions within massive galaxies. By inhibiting excessive gas cooling and star formation in these galaxies, AGN feedback leads to a reduction in gas fractions and influences the Lx-T relation. The inclusion of AGN feedback in the simulations enhances the alignment between observed and simulated scaling relations. Furthermore, analyzing galaxy clusters' characteristics, such as gas fraction and the Lx-T relation, offers insights into how AGN feedback shapes galaxy formation and evolution. These findings underscore the necessity for refined simulations that consider multiple factors influencing galaxy cluster evolution, enabling more accurate predictions of observable universe properties.",
