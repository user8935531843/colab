    "original": "Part 1 of this paper showcases the innovative architecture of Adaptive Optics (AO) control utilizing Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) with a focus on their parallel processing capability. Through implementation on an off-the-shelf Xilinx VC-709 development board, SPARC's adaptability in Real-time Control (RTC) for diverse AO scenarios is demonstrated. The scalability of SPARC across varying numbers of subapertures and pixels per subaperture is highlighted, making it a versatile RTC kernel. The paper details the concept, objectives, architecture, validation, and simulation and hardware test results of SPARC. The AO reconstruction time for Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensors on the development board ranges from a median of 39.4us to 1.283 ms, with latency influenced by DDR memory access time for large wavefront sensors. Part 1 caters to astronomers seeking insights into the hardware's current capabilities. Part 2 delves into the FPGA implementation of the wavefront processing unit, the reconstruction algorithm, and the platform's hardware interfaces, targeting embedded developers keen on the hardware implementation of SPARC.",
