    "original": "This study delves into the impact of Y-substitution on the structural characteristics and spin-phonon coupling in orthorhombic GdMnO$_{3}$. Through the utilization of X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy techniques, the alterations in crystal structure induced by Y-substitution are examined. The results indicate a reduction in orthorhombic distortion and an expansion of the unit cell volume due to the substitution. Furthermore, analysis of the Raman spectra highlights vibrational modes associated with Y-substitution, attributed to modifications in Mn-O and Gd-O bond lengths. Magnetization measurements are utilized to probe the magnetic properties of Y-substituted GdMnO$_{3}$, revealing changes in the magnetic ground state post-substitution. Additionally, the investigation of spin-phonon coupling, conducted by analyzing the temperature-dependent Raman spectra, unveils the impact of Y-substitution on magnon-phonon coupling in GdMnO$_{3}$. The study offers valuable insights into the structural and magnetic characteristics of Y-substituted GdMnO$_{3}, paving the way for the development of advanced materials with tailored electronic and magnetic properties.",
