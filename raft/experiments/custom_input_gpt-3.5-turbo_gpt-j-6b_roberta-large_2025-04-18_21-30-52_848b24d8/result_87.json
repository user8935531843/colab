    "original": "Nonlinear blind source separation (BSS) involves identifying statistically independent combinations of components in a time series of multicomponent measurements x(t) to generate distinct source time series s(t). The objective is to derive a source time series with a density function in (s, ds/dt)-space that equals the product of density functions of individual components. This formulation leads to a unique solution, with considerations of permutations and component-wise transformations. Separability dictates constraints on certain locally invariant functions of x, deduced from local higher-order correlations of the data's velocity dx/dt. The data's separability hinges on satisfying these constraints, and if met, the sources can be explicitly constructed from the data. To illustrate this method, two speech-like sounds recorded with a single microphone are subjected to the process.",
