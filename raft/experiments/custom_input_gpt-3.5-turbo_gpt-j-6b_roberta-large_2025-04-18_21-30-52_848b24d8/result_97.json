    "original": "Consider two point sets $A$ and $B$ in the plane, with sizes $r$ and $n$ respectively, where $r \\leq n$, and a parameter $k$. A matching between $A$ and $B$ is defined as a set of pairs in $A \\times B$, ensuring that each point in $A \\cup B$ is present in at most one pair. The cost of a matching $M$ is calculated as $c(M) = \\sum_{(a, b) \\in M}\\|{a-b}\\|_p^q$, where $\\|{\\cdot}\\|_p$ denotes the $L_p$-norm. The geometric partial matching problem aims to identify the minimum-cost matching of size $k$ between $A$ and $B$. Efficient algorithms have been devised for this problem, accommodating various powers of the $L_p$-norm matching objective: an exact algorithm with a runtime of $O((n + k^2) {\\mathop{\\mathrm{polylog}}} n)$, and a $(1 + \\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm operating in $O((n + k\\sqrt{k}) {\\mathop{\\mathrm{polylog}}} n \\cdot \\log\\varepsilon^{-1})$ time. These algorithms leverage the primal-dual flow augmentation scheme, with enhancements in efficient flow augmentations achieved through the utilization of dynamic data structures. Additionally, an exact algorithm for the planar transportation problem is presented, with a time complexity of $O(\\min\\{n^2, rn^{3/2}\\} {\\mathop{\\mathrm{polylog}}} n)$, also employing similar techniques for improved efficiency.",
