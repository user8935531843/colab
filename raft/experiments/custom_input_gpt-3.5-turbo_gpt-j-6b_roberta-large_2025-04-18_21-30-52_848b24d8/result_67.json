    "original": "The QCD Equation of State is investigated at non-zero chemical potentials related to conserved charges in QCD, through a Taylor expansion up to the sixth order in baryon number, electric charge, and strangeness chemical potentials. Strangeness neutrality and a set electric charge to baryon number ratio constrain the electric charge and strangeness chemical potentials. The calculations utilize the Highly Improved Staggered Quarks (HISQ) discretization scheme with physical quark masses and varying lattice spacings to manage lattice cut-off effects. Additionally, pressure is computed along constant energy density lines, acting as proxies for freeze-out conditions, with a discussion on their correlation with $\\mu_B$ for hydrodynamic modeling near freezeout. A convergence radius estimation based on sixth order coefficients imposes a novel constraint on determining the critical end-point location in the T-$\\mu_B$ plane of the QCD phase diagram.",
