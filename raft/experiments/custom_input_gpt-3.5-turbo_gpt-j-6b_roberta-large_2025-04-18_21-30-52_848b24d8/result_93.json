    "original": "Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a progressive neurological condition characterized by symptoms such as rigidity, tremors, and postural instability, posing challenges in accurate diagnosis. Conventionally diagnosed through clinical assessments, misdiagnosis rates ranging from 10-30% underscore the need for precise and efficient diagnostic tools. To address this gap, this study introduces LPGNet, a novel method leveraging Linear Prediction Residuals (LPR) extracted from gait recordings to discern patterns indicative of PD. LPGNet features a 1D convolutional neural network with depth-wise separable convolutions, achieving a high AUC of 0.91 with a substantial speedup and reduced model parameters compared to existing approaches. Furthermore, an investigation into cross-validation strategies in PD diagnosis reveals prevalent data leakage issues across folds in current methodologies, leading to inflated performance metrics and model overfitting. This analysis serves to guide future research towards more robust evaluation practices in PD diagnostic tools.",
