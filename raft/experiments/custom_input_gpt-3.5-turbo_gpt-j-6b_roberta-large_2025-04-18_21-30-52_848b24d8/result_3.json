    "original": "Deep sets present a novel methodology for analyzing unordered data sets by treating the input set as a mathematical entity, allowing for the utilization of permutation-invariant neural networks to derive set representations. This approach enables deep sets to address various tasks such as set classification, set similarity assessment, and set-to-set prediction. A notable advantage of deep sets lies in their capability to accommodate sets of varying sizes, making them particularly beneficial in applications like graph embeddings and point cloud analysis. While deep sets have shown success in data analysis, challenges persist in effectively training them and managing large-scale datasets. This review examines recent advancements in deep sets, outlining their theoretical and practical implications, shedding light on their applications across diverse domains, and pinpointing existing obstacles and future trajectories. In essence, deep sets offer a potent avenue for analyzing sets, poised to emerge as a pivotal tool in the realm of data science.",
