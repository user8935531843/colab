    "original": "In a recent study, we have successfully achieved laser cooling of a single $^{40}$Ca$^+$ ion to the motional ground state in a Penning trap using resolved-sideband cooling on the electric quadrupole transition S$_{1/2} \\leftrightarrow$ D$_{5/2}$. We have expanded this cooling technique to small ion Coulomb crystals composed of two or three $^{40}$Ca$^+$ ions. Efficient cooling of axial motion has been accomplished outside the Lamb-Dicke regime on a two-ion string parallel to the magnetic field axis, as well as on two- and three-ion planar crystals. Complex sideband cooling sequences have been devised to simultaneously cool both axial degrees of freedom. Following cooling, a mean excitation of $\\bar n_\\text{COM}=0.30(4)$ has been observed for the centre of mass mode and $\\bar n_\\text{B}=0.07(3)$ for the breathing mode of the two-ion string, with corresponding heating rates of 11(2) s$^{-1}$ and 1(1) s$^{-1}$ at a trap frequency of 162 kHz. Additionally, the ground state occupation of axial modes surpasses 75% for the two-ion planar crystal, accompanied by associated heating rates of 0.8(5) s$^{-1}$ at a trap frequency of 355 kHz.",
