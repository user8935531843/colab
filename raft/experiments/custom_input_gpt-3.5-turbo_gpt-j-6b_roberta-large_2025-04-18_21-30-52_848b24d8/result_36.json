    "original": "An Fe(001) ultra-thin film grown epitaxially on MgO(001) underwent oxidation through post-deposition annealing in an oxygen environment. LEED analysis revealed the development of magnetite (Fe$_3$O$_4$) after one hour of oxygen exposure, with the LEED pattern remaining stable even after four additional hours of annealing. XPS analysis of the Fe $2p$ core levels indicated the presence of an iron oxide primarily composed of trivalent iron. The discrepancy between LEED and XPS results was investigated using charge transfer multiplet calculations for the Fe $2p$ XPS spectra. It was concluded that Mg ion migration from the substrate into the magnetite film, substituting Fe$^{2+}$ ions in octahedral coordination, and the increased occupancy of octahedral sites not filled in the ideal inverse spinel structure, were key factors influencing the altered shape of the Fe $2p$ XPS spectra. Various models were considered to explain the mechanism of Mg ion segregation into the magnetite films.",
