    "original": "This study focuses on the challenge of estimating time-of-flight (ToF) using channel state information (CSI) acquired from MIMO-OFDM WLAN receivers. Prior to this study, concerns were raised about the accuracy of ToF-based positioning due to errors in the CSI phase, both known and unknown. To address this issue, a methodical approach was taken, starting with a comprehensive understanding of CSI, its components, and sources of error. These effects were then mathematically modeled and validated through extensive measurements, including radiated, conducted, and chamber tests. By identifying and characterizing errors in CSI, preprocessing techniques were introduced to mitigate these errors and improve range estimation accuracy. The effectiveness of these algorithms was confirmed through the application of the MUSIC super-resolution algorithm on the cleaned CSI data, resulting in a median accuracy of 0.6m to 0.9m in line-of-sight environments with varying distances between transmitter and receiver.",
