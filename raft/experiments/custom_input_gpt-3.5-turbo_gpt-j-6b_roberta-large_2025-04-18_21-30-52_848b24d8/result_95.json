    "original": "The investigation focuses on examining the characteristics of the central star and plasma properties of PC 22, a planetary nebula enriched with heavy elements. Through a comprehensive approach utilizing ground-based and space-based observations, high-resolution spectra were obtained across various wavelengths to analyze plasma conditions and infer electron density and temperature using theoretical methods. Results reveal the central star of PC 22 as a hot subdwarf O star with an effective temperature of approximately 80 kK, with prominent neon lines indicating the existence of a He-burning shell within the star. The ionization of the nebula by the central star is implied by the plasma conditions, showcasing a nearly flat density profile in the inner region and a sharp decline towards the outer boundaries. Comparative analysis with other planetary nebulae suggests that PC 22 belongs to a category of \"mature\" nebulae derived from a high-mass progenitor star, advancing our understanding of planetary nebula formation, evolution, and the role of central stars in shaping their characteristics.",
