    "original": "Nearly a century ago, the nova outburst of Nova Aquilae 1918 (NA1918), also known as V603 Aquilae, was first observed and has since been subject to extensive research to monitor its fluctuations. By applying an astrophysical approach based on optical-UV spectra, our study highlights a gradual decrease in brightness of NA1918 over an extended period. The nova has dimmed by approximately 0.44 magnitudes per century between 1938 and 2013, a trend that is evident in historical data spanning about 75 years. Our analysis reveals a smooth decline in brightness characterized by a linear fit to the available observations, indicative of the gradual cooling of the remnant envelope following the initial energy eruption of the nova outburst, which peaked at a magnitude of around 7.0. Our findings suggest that this fading trajectory of NA1918 may have persisted for millennia, shedding light on the underlying physical mechanisms governing novae. Further exploration will explore whether similar diminishing patterns are universal across other nova outbursts.",
