    "original": "Analyses of cosmological hydrodynamic simulations have revealed that X-ray masses of galaxy clusters may be underestimated by up to 30%, primarily due to deviations in hydrostatic equilibrium and temperature biases stemming from inhomogeneities in the X-ray-emitting intra-cluster medium (ICM). A comparative study was conducted on cluster simulations using smoothed-particle-hydrodynamics (SPH) and adaptive-mesh-refinement (AMR) codes to investigate the extent of temperature variations within cluster sets. It was observed that SPH simulations exhibited more pronounced temperature fluctuations associated with substructures and stripped cold gas, particularly evident in non-radiative simulations but mitigated in simulations incorporating radiative cooling. At R_500, the temperature inhomogeneities from SPH simulations could lead to a mass bias twice the magnitude of that in AMR simulations. To further comprehend the intricate thermal structure of the ICM, enhanced resolution and high-sensitivity observations are crucial for examining higher temperature systems and extending the analysis to larger cluster-centric radii.",
