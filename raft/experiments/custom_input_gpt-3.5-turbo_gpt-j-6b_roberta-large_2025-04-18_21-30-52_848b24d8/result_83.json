    "original": "The impact of gas shock heating during cosmic structure formation on the ultraviolet background (UVB) is evaluated using an updated version of the Press-Schechter formalism. This assessment aligns with empirical estimations derived from galaxy properties and cosmic star formation history. Thermal emission originating from objects in the mass range of 10^{11-13} M_solar, primarily large galaxies and small groups, serves as the predominant radiation source. Comparative analysis reveals that thermal emission, particularly near 1 Ry, is on par with stellar contributions and constitutes approximately 10%, 20%, and 35% of the total flux at redshifts of 3, 4.5, and higher, respectively. Notably, close to the HeII ionization threshold, thermal emissions rival QSO intensity by redshift ~3 and dominate at redshifts above 4. Remarkably, thermal photons alone can instigate and uphold HeII reionization as early as z~6. The notable Gunn-Peterson effect at elevated redshifts (3<z<6) imposes restrictions on the escape fraction of ionizing photons from galaxies to below a few percent.",
