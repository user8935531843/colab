    "original": "Recently, differentiable neural architecture search techniques have seen advancements in reducing search costs through the construction of a super network and the relaxation of architecture representations via the assignment of architecture weights to candidate operations. However, existing methods often struggle to accurately determine the importance of each operation solely through architecture weights, leading to potential performance discrepancies. Introducing a novel approach to neural architecture search, referred to as Exploiting Operation Importance for Effective Neural Architecture Search (EoiNAS), a new indicator is proposed to fully leverage operation importance and guide model search processes. In addition, a gradual operation pruning strategy is implemented to further enhance search efficiency and accuracy. Experimental validation of the proposed method has highlighted its effectiveness, showcasing an impressive error rate of 2.50% on CIFAR-10 and competitive performance with a top-1 error of 25.6% on ImageNet, aligning with the highest standards in the field.",
