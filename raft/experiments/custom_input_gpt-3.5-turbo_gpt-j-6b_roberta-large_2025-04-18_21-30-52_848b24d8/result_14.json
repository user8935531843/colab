    "original": "This research delves into the interplay of Casimir energy in a fermion system intertwined with a Sine-Gordon soliton and the ensuing parity decomposition. Through an extensive examination, we analyze the Casimir energy's correlation with the mass of the fermion and the coupling parameter of the soliton. Utilizing numerical simulations, our study reveals a non-linear trend in the Casimir energy concerning the fermion mass and soliton coupling constant. Notably, our findings demonstrate that the Casimir energy can oscillate between positive and negative values contingent upon these parameters. This behavior is attributed to the interplay between the fermion and the soliton, triggering alterations in the vacuum structure via the energy density. Our discoveries hold significance in comprehending quantum field theories in curved spacetime and present promising avenues for potential applications in advancing quantum computing technologies. Finally, we outline the implications and potential research pathways spurred by our results.",
