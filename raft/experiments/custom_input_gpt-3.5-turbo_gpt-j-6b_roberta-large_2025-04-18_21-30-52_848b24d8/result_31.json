    "original": "The Lense-Thirring metric, a classic approximation to the gravitational field outside a rotating massive body, is based on the source's total mass and angular momentum. While not an exact solution to the vacuum Einstein equations, this metric tends towards the Kerr metric at large distances. In this discussion, we focus on a specific variation of the standard Lense-Thirring metric, chosen for simplicity, clarity, and enhanced functionality. Specifically, we introduce a unit-lapse Painleve-Gullstrand variant of the Lense-Thirring spacetime, featuring flat spatial slices, a straightforward tetrad structure, and simplified curvature tensors. Our analysis confirms that this variant of the Lense-Thirring spacetime conforms to Petrov type I, indicating no algebraically special properties, yet offers easily comprehensible timelike geodesics, including the notable \"rain\" geodesics. We also explore on-axis and equatorial geodesics, the innermost stable circular orbits (ISCOs), circular photon orbits, and make astrophysically relevant estimations. Furthermore, we delve into the implications of extrapolating these findings to smaller values of r.",
