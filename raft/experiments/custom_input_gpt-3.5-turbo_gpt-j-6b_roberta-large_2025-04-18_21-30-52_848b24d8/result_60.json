    "original": "The pursuit of unique superconductors capable of supporting Majorana fermions, integral for quantum computing and dark matter applications, has led to the uncovering of topological superconductivity in organic compounds. Through experiments conducted on 1T'-MoS2 flakes undergoing a superconductor-insulator transition following electron-beam radiation exposure, Majorana corner and hinge modes were observed in an intrinsic organic topological superconductor at room temperature, eliminating the need for external magnetic fields. Employing scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy, the manifestation of topological superconductivity on the edges and corners of these flakes was directly visualized, further supplemented by spectroscopic confirmation of Majorana zero-energy modes. These results underscore the potential for leveraging organic materials in realizing Majorana physics and paving the way for scalable Majorana-based quantum devices critical for fault-tolerant quantum computing. This breakthrough is anticipated to inspire further investigations into topological superconductivity in additional organic materials and the innovation of novel quantum technologies.",
