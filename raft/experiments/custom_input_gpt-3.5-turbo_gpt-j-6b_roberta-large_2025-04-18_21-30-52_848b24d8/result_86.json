Observations deviate from $\\nu=1/2$, showcasing a consistent area reflecting $k^*_{\\rm F}=\\sqrt{4\\pi\\rho_e}$ for $\\nu<1/2$, while displaying $k^*_{\\rm F}=\\sqrt{4\\pi\\rho_h}$ for $\\nu>1/2$, with $\\rho_h$ representing the density of holes within the lowest Landau level. Such findings align with the concept of particle-hole symmetry within the lowest Landau level. The article focuses on investigating the Fermi wave vector of the spin-singlet CF Fermi sea (CFFS) at $\\nu=1/2\", a scenario where particle-hole symmetry does not hold relevance. Adopting a microscopic CF theory approach, it is deduced that for the spin-singlet CFFS, the Fermi wave vectors for up and down spin CFFSs at $\\nu=1/2$ adhere to $k^{*\\uparrow,\\downarrow}_{\\rm F}=\\sqrt{4\\pi\\rho^{\\uparrow,\\downarrow}_e}$, with $\\rho^{\\uparrow}_e=\\rho^{\\downarrow}_e=\\rho_e/2$, signifying that residual interactions among composite fermions do not introduce non-perturbative corrections for non-fully spin polarized CFFS. The analysis suggests a plausible conjecture that the CF Fermi wave vectors for arbitrary spin polarization are governed by $k^{*\\uparrow}_{\\rm F}=\\sqrt{4\\pi\\rho^{\\uparrow}_e}$ and $k^{*\\downarrow}_{\\rm F}=\\sqrt{4\\pi\\rho^{\\downarrow}_e}\".",
