    "original": "Spin-transfer torques within magnetic nanocontacts can induce self-sustained magnetization oscillations characterized by significant gyrotropic vortex motion. This intricate dynamic behavior entails a stable orbital trajectory around the nanocontact, where spin torques counteract intrinsic magnetic damping. The analysis presented in this study introduces an analytical framework for understanding the power spectrum of these oscillations using a rigid-vortex model. Notably, the emergence of vortex oscillations in nanocontacts is not contingent on a Hopf bifurcation, as there is no critical current threshold. Instead, steady-state oscillations at finite currents are facilitated by the presence of a vortex within the system, diverging from conventional spin-torque oscillators predicated on extensive magnetization precession. The oscillation frequency linearly correlates with the applied current and inversely with the orbital radius. Through the resolution of the associated Langevin problem, the power spectrum's lineshape and linewidth are elucidated, revealing a Lorentzian profile with a constant linewidth under standard experimental conditions. A robust congruence between the theoretical predictions and empirical observations is demonstrated.",
