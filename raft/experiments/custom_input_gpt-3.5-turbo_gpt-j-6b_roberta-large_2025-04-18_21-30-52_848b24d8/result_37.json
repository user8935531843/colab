    "original": "The upper critical field of Tl$_{0.58}$Rb$_{0.42}$Fe$_{1.72}$Se$_2$ single crystals was determined through measurements of electrical resistivity in both pulsed magnetic fields and DC magnetic fields. The results show a linear increase of the critical field with decreasing temperature for magnetic field orientations parallel and perpendicular to the crystallographic c-axis, reaching values of approximately 60T at 0K. Anisotropy of the upper critical field is observed, with a stronger curvature for the field perpendicular to the c-axis at 18K. Analysis based on the Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg method suggests an orbitally limited behavior for the field parallel to the c-axis, while the impact of spin paramagnetism is significant for the field perpendicular to the c-axis. These findings point towards a unified scenario for iron-based superconductors, with similarities to iron pnictide superconductors. Additionally, the application of a magnetic field leads to a broadening of the superconducting transition, indicating the presence of strong thermal fluctuation effects in the superconducting state of Tl$_{0.58}$Rb$_{0.42}$Fe$_{1.72}$Se$_2$. The thermal activation energy for vortex motion aligns with that observed in 1111-type iron pnictides.",
