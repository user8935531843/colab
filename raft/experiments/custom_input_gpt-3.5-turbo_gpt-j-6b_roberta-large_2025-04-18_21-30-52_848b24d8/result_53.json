    "original": "The research discussed in the paper focuses on exploring communication limitations in a compound channel. While covert communication in information theory typically addresses concealing communication from adversaries, this study delves into concealing the state of the compound channel itself. This model is particularly relevant in scenarios where malicious entities attempt to disrupt communication signals by jamming low signal-to-noise ratio channels. The main contribution of the paper lies in establishing throughput-key region bounds under a covert communication constraint based on total variation distance. Additionally, for cases where key length is infinite, a sufficient condition for bounds convergence in throughput scaling following a square-root law is provided. Numerical illustrations, such as the Gaussian channel example, are presented to demonstrate the findings.",
