    "original": "Addressing the intricate connections between social networks and economic status in contemporary societies, we deploy an extensive study analyzing the interplay of wealth distribution and social structures. By leveraging large-scale multimodal data encompassing mobile phone communications and banking transactions of a million anonymized individuals in a Latin American setting, we unveil disparities in wealth allocation that align with the Pareto principle. Our findings reveal a stratified social structure marked by people predominantly associating with others of similar socioeconomic backgrounds, forming tightly-knit \"rich clubs\" within the social network. Additionally, individuals from the same economic class tend to reside in close proximity while exhibiting greater mobility if they are wealthier, underscoring the nuanced interplay between social relationships, economic status, and human mobility. These empirical results shed light on longstanding hypotheses regarding socioeconomic correlations, shedding light on the underlying factors shaping social segregation and mobility patterns.",
