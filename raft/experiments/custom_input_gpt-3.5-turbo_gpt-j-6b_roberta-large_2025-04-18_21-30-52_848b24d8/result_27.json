    "original": "In this study, we address the challenge of estimating the graph connected to a binary Ising Markov random field. Our approach involves utilizing $\\ell_1$-regularized logistic regression to estimate the neighborhood of each node by conducting logistic regression while adhering to an $\\ell_1$ constraint. The method is evaluated within a high-dimensional context, where the number of nodes $p$ and maximum neighborhood size $d$ are permitted to grow relative to the number of observations $n$. Key findings establish criteria on the triple $(n,p,d)$ and model parameters for the method to consistently estimate the neighborhood of all nodes in the graph simultaneously. By enforcing coherence conditions on the population Fisher information matrix, we demonstrate the ability to achieve consistent neighborhood selection with sample sizes of $n=\\Omega(d^3\\log p)$ and exponentially decreasing error rates. Extending these conditions to sample matrices reveals that a reduced sample size of $n=\\Omega(d^2\\log p)$ is adequate for achieving consistent neighborhood estimation. While the paper specifically focuses on binary graphical models, we highlight the potential for generalizing the method to apply to broader discrete Markov random fields.",
