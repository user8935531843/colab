    "original": "Our study introduces a point-form methodology for analyzing the structural composition of baryons, which are composed of three quarks and play a pivotal role in understanding subatomic matter. By scrutinizing the spatial arrangement of quarks within each baryon as points within a three-dimensional framework, we can glean valuable insights into their characteristics and behavior. Our findings underscore the close correlation between the orientation and shape of point distributions and the internal dynamics of baryons, encompassing attributes like spin and momentum. Furthermore, our methodology enables us to make informed projections about baryon behavior under varying conditions, such as high-energy environments or the influence of strong external forces. Overall, our point-form approach stands as a robust tool for delving into the fundamental essence of baryonic structures and their significance in the cosmic landscape.",
