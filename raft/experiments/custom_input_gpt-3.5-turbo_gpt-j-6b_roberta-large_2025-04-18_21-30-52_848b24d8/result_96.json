    "original": "Analyzing public sentiment and perception during a health crisis like COVID-19 is crucial for formulating effective crisis management strategies. While previous studies have utilized Twitter data for predictive modeling purposes in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, a detailed sentiment analysis of social media user opinions during this crisis has not been extensively conducted. In this study, we conduct an exhaustive and fine-grained sentiment analysis of tweets related to COVID-19. Our approach involves supervised training of four transformer language models to perform multi-label classification of tweets into seven tone classes, including confident, anger, fear, joy, sadness, analytical, and tentative. Leveraging RoBERTa, we achieve a high LRAP (Label Ranking Average Precision) score of 0.9267, indicating the model's accurate prediction of tweet tones. Subsequently, we utilize this trained transformer model to predict tones for a dataset comprising 200,000 COVID-19 related tweets. Additionally, we conduct a country-specific analysis of tweet tones and extract valuable insights pertaining to the psychological well-being of individuals amidst the pandemic.",
