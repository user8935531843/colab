    "original": "Optical flow is a common method for motion segmentation in moving camera videos, but it may lead to depth-dependent segmentation issues, especially when objects are at varying depths from the camera. To address this, an algorithm is developed to cluster pixels with similar real-world motion regardless of their depth. Utilizing optical flow orientations, the algorithm leverages the property that these orientations remain consistent under camera translation, independent of object depth. A probabilistic model is introduced to automatically estimate the number of observed independent motions, ensuring a labeling that aligns with real-world motion. This approach ensures accurate identification of static objects as a single segment, even across different depths in the scene. Color features and historical frame information are also utilized to refine occasional errors arising from the orientation-based segmentation. Results from analyzing numerous videos demonstrate the system's robustness, particularly in complex scenes with objects at varying depths.",
