    "original": "Robots and rovers have revolutionized space exploration by serving as essential tools for data collection. A critical challenge faced by these robots is loop closing, involving accurately retracing previously explored areas and determining the robot's location. This study introduces a novel approach for multi-modal loop closing in unstructured planetary environments utilizing visually enriched submaps. By integrating various sensors such as monocular cameras, stereo cameras, and LIDAR, this method enhances localization accuracy and facilitates more effective loop closing. The visually enriched submaps offer detailed environmental information, including terrain characteristics and lighting conditions, which are typically challenging to capture. Experimental results conducted on the Europlanet-2020 Research Infrastructure illustrate that this method enhances the efficiency and dependability of loop closing in unstructured environments. This innovative approach has the potential to advance the capabilities of planetary rovers and their exploration of extraterrestrial landscapes.",
