    "original": "The impact of disorder on the longitudinal resistance of a graphene p-n junction in the quantum Hall regime is explored through a Landauer-Büttiker formalism and a self-consistent potential profile analysis. Our study indicates a direct correlation between disorder levels and longitudinal resistance, with higher disorder resulting in increased resistance. Moreover, we demonstrate the significant role of localization length in shaping the transport properties of the system. By manipulating magnetic fields and electron density, we observe a notable reduction in longitudinal resistance with increased magnetic field strength, while electron density shows minimal effect on resistance behavior. These findings offer valuable insights for optimizing graphene p-n junction devices in applications like high-speed transistors, low-power electronics, and quantum computing.",
