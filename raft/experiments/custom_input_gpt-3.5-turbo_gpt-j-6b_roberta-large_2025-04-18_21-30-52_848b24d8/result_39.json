    "original": "In this study, the analysis of three-body $B_{(s)} \\to \\eta_c(1S,2S) K \\pi$ decays is conducted using the perturbative QCD approach (PQCD) under the quasi-two-body approximation. The kaon-pion invariant mass spectra are predominantly influenced by resonances such as $K_0^*(1430)^0, K_0^*(1950)^0, K^*(892)^0, K^*(1410)^0, K^*(1680)^0$, and $K_2^*(1430)^0$. The time-like form factors are utilized to parameterize the $S, P, D$-wave kaon-pion distribution amplitudes, depicting the interactions between the kaon and pion in the resonant region. The $K\\pi$ $S$-wave component at a low $K\\pi$ mass is modeled by the LASS line shape, while other resonances' time-like form factors are represented by the relativistic Breit-Wigner function. The study reveals that the PQCD estimations of branching ratios for most $B \\to \\eta_c(1S)(K^{*0}\\to )K^+\\pi^-$ decays align with current data within acceptable margins. Furthermore, for ${\\cal B}(B^0 \\to \\eta_c (K_0^*(1430)\\to )K^+\\pi^-)$ and ${\\cal B}(B^0 \\to \\eta_c K^+\\pi^-({\\rm NR}))$, the predicted branching ratios are slightly lower than the experimental measurements. The implications of $D$-wave contributions can be further elucidated with precise data from forthcoming experiments such as LHCb and Belle-II.",
