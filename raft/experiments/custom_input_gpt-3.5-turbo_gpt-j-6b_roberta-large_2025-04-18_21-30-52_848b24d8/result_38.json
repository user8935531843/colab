    "original": "Endocytosis, a pivotal process in eukaryotic cells, involves the internalization of membrane-bound proteins and lipids through the invagination of the plasma membrane. Critical for cellular functions like nutrient absorption, membrane mending, and cell signaling, endocytosis is intricately explored using the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model organism due to its simplicity. Nonetheless, accurately modeling endocytosis in yeast poses challenges owing to the process's complexity and the limited understanding of its molecular intricacies. This study presents a comprehensive model of yeast endocytosis, amalgamating experimental and theoretical insights. By combining molecular interactions at the protein level with membrane curvature and tension at the cellular scale, a multi-scale mathematical model is proposed, validated through both in vitro and in vivo experiments. This model sheds light on the dynamics and regulation of endocytosis, providing a platform for uncovering novel endocytic regulators and developing therapeutics for endocytosis-related disorders.",
