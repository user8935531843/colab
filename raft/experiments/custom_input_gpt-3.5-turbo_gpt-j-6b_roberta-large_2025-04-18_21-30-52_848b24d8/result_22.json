    "original": "The emergence of spatiotemporal data across diverse fields has underscored the necessity for sophisticated statistical learning techniques that factor in spatial and temporal interdependencies. This study introduces the R package Mlr3spatiotempcv, which furnishes multiple resampling methods to evaluate the efficacy of machine learning models considering spatiotemporal details. The package encompasses an array of spatial and temporal cross-validation techniques like the block bootstrap and sliding window methodologies, accommodating regression, classification, and survival analysis tasks. Notably, Mlr3spatiotempcv facilitates user-friendly interfaces for spatiotemporal feature selection and hyperparameter tuning, fundamental procedures for optimizing model performance. Leveraging R's robust parallel computing capabilities, the package ensures swift computation of resampling-based performance assessments. By elevating the existing machine learning toolkit in R for spatiotemporal data analysis, Mlr3spatiotempcv establishes a sturdy foundation for crafting and assessing predictive models across various domains, including climate science, environmental surveillance, and epidemiology.",
