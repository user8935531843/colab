    "original": "This study explores the Sharp Hardy-Sobolev-Maz'ya, Adams, and Hardy-Adams inequalities on quaternionic hyperbolic spaces and the Cayley hyperbolic plane. Initially, the research establishes the sharp Adams inequality for the quaternionic hyperbolic space and derives a novel form of the Poincaré inequality, leading to the derivation of the Sobolev inequality. Subsequently, the paper proves the optimality of the sharp Hardy-Sobolev-Maz'ya inequality for the quaternionic hyperbolic space within a specific parameter range. Transitioning to the Cayley hyperbolic plane, a sharp Hardy-Adams inequality is established, expanding the renowned Hardy and Adams inequalities from Euclidean spaces to the context of the Cayley hyperbolic plane. Additionally, a sharp inequality for functions with zero mean value on this space is derived, indicating the presence of a weighted Hardy inequality. The study delves into the optimality of these inequalities through illustrative examples and extends to proving the sharp Hardy-Adams inequality for the unit ball in the Cayley hyperbolic plane. Overall, these findings enhance the comprehension of the geometry and analysis of quaternionic hyperbolic spaces and Cayley hyperbolic planes.",
