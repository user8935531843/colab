    "original": "The Tolman--Oppenheimer--Volkoff (TOV) equations depict the composition of isotropic spherically symmetric static fluids through an intricate system of nonlinear and non-autonomous ordinary differential equations. Finding explicit solutions for TOV systems is a challenging task due to the complexity and rarity of such solutions. This study introduces the concept of pseudo-asymptotic TOV systems and demonstrates that the space of such systems encompasses at least fifteen dimensions. It is further revealed that well-behaved pseudo-asymptotic TOV systems within a suitable domain can be considered genuine TOV systems, leading to the discovery of new analytic solutions for extended TOV equations. These solutions are categorized based on the type of matter involved (ordinary or exotic) and the presence of cavities and singularities. Notably, three of the solutions are deemed realistic, characterized by the absence of cavities or singularities and comprising only ordinary matter.",
