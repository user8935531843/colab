    "original": "In response to the growing challenges posed by the escalating utilization of renewable energy sources, the integration of energy storage systems (ESS) into the smart grid emerges as a pivotal solution. While rapid advancements in ESS technology are witnessed, the impediment of a robust evaluation and deployment framework hinders the seamless integration of ESS into the smart grid. This manuscript advocates for a prospect theoretic strategy to streamline the incorporation of ESS into the smart grid. Leveraging prospect theory, our approach accommodates decision biases and risk perceptions that shape decision-makers' assessments of ESS projects. The proposed methodology encompasses three key phases: (i) identification of decision-makers' viewpoints and risk perceptions on ESS projects, (ii) assessment of the economic and technical viability of ESS projects, and (iii) development of a decision-making framework that facilitates the integration of ESS projects into the smart grid. Through a real-world case study illustrating the integration of energy storage into a microgrid, our approach showcases its efficacy in offering a dependable decision-making framework for integrating ESS projects into the smart grid. By aiding decision-makers in navigating the mounting demand for renewable energy and addressing uncertainty in the integration of energy storage, the prospect theoretic approach holds promise in enhancing the functionality and reliability of the smart grid.",
