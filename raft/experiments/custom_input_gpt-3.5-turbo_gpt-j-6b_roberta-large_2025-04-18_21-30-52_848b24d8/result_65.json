    "original": "In this study, we analyze the scaling properties of bipolar outflows commonly found in the vicinity of young stellar objects, often attributed to magnetohydrodynamic forces. By conducting a multifractal analysis of scattered near-infrared light from dust grains in the lobes of seven bipolar nebulae, including GGD 18, V380 Orionis, LkH\\alpha 101/NGC 1579, LkH\\alpha 233, PV Cephei, V645 Cygni (GL 2789), and V633 Cassiopeiae (LkH\\alpha 198), we propose that these objects belong to a multifractal universality class. Our findings reveal universal parameters averaged across the dataset, portraying alpha= 1.96 +/- 0.02, C_1=0.04 +/- 0.02, and H=0.7 +/- 0.2, suggesting similarities in the dynamics of these objects. Furthermore, we explore the presence of anisotropy in the scaling of GGD 18 using the Generalized Scale Invariance (GSI) formalism, pinpointing differential rotation and stratification as key components of the outflow mechanism. The observed stratification is posited to possess a dynamic nature, indicating a non-gravitational predominance in the stratifying forces.",
