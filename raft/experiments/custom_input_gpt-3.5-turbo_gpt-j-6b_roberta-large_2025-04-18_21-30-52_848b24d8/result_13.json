    "original": "The disintegration of Comet ISON in November 2013 has been linked to various factors, including its proximity to the Sun. This study delves into the impact of dynamic sublimation pressure on the comet's catastrophic breakup. Dynamic sublimation pressure results from the gas generated by sublimation being trapped near the comet's surface, leading to a pressure build-up. By introducing a model to quantify this pressure, it was found to exceed the pressure caused by the solar wind by several times. This discovery indicates that dynamic sublimation pressure plays a significant role in the evolution of comets, especially as they approach the Sun. Additionally, the model suggests that comets with lower sublimation rates are less likely to experience catastrophic breakup due to reduced dynamic pressure. These findings have important implications for understanding cometary dynamics and interpreting future observations of comets.",
