    "original": "Online repositories hosting user-generated 3D shapes serve as repositories of detailed surface, primitive, and geometric data, often organized hierarchically. A novel framework has been introduced to learn representations of 3D shapes that encapsulate the intricacies of this metadata, leading to enhanced performance in semantic segmentation tasks. The proposed model, a point embedding network, generates vectorial representations of 3D points that encode the grouping hierarchy and tag data. Overcoming challenges posed by noisy and varied data, a tree-aware metric-learning approach is introduced, demonstrating the efficacy of learned embeddings in facilitating seamless transfer to semantic segmentation tasks, particularly in scenarios with limited training data. The approach showcases a reduction in relative error by $10.2\\% with 8 training examples and $11.72\\% with 120 training examples on the ShapeNet semantic segmentation benchmark compared to training networks from scratch. Leveraging tag data further reduces relative error by $12.8% with 8 training examples, showcasing substantial improvements without additional labeling costs due to the availability of metadata.",
