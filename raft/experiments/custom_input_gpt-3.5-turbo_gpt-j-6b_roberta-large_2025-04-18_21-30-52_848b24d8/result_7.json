    "original": "Our research delves into the identification and categorization of quantum pseudo-telepathy occurrences within the graph isomorphism game, leveraging the recent discovery linking quantum information and quantum automorphism group theory. By establishing a direct linkage between graphs quantum isomorphic to a given graph and Morita equivalence classes of specific Frobenius algebras within the realm of finite-dimensional representations of the quantum automorphism algebra of the said graph, we illuminate the intricate relationships at play. Notably, we highlight the construction of a Frobenius algebra stemming from a central type subgroup of the classical automorphism group, characterized by coisotropic vertex stabilizers in the graph. Our findings showcase the correspondence between quantum isomorphic graphs and subgroup structures, particularly elucidating the classification of quantum isomorphic graph pairs in relation to binary constraint systems. Additionally, we demonstrate that for small order vertex-transitive graphs lacking quantum symmetries, none are quantum isomorphic to non-isomorphic graphs, a result that holds asymptotically true for all graphs.",
