Cooperative play not only builds a robust social network but also nurtures skills like sharing, compromising, and collaborating. Teaching children to cooperate is crucial as it cultivates a skill that holds immense value in their future endeavors. Collaboration is a fundamental aspect of adult life, where teamwork is often required to accomplish common objectives. Additionally, learning to cooperate can be enjoyable for children, enhancing their overall experience. Cooperative play promotes enjoyment and engagement, as illustrated by the example of my son relishing the game \"Cops and Robbers,\" where he had to collaborate with others to win.
