    "original": "There is ongoing debate regarding whether children should be taught to compete or cooperate. Certain individuals argue that learning to compete is crucial for success in life, while others emphasize the significance of cooperation in interpersonal relationships. In my opinion, both competitive and cooperative skills are essential, and children should be educated in both. Competing and cooperating are integral aspects of daily life, with competition being useful for achieving specific goals such as winning a race or securing a job promotion, and cooperation being vital for collaborative endeavors like team projects or conflict resolution. Although some advocate for an exclusive focus on competition to prepare children for success, I believe that fostering cooperative skills is equally important. Cooperation enables individuals to work harmoniously with others and facilitates the attainment of goals that would be unattainable when working in isolation. For instance, a team of individuals collaborating can construct a house more efficiently than a solitary worker. Moreover, cooperation aids in conflict resolution, enabling individuals to reach mutually acceptable solutions efficiently. While competition may not always facilitate resolving conflicts satisfactorily, cooperation fosters amicable agreements. Therefore, I maintain that children should be equipped with both competitive and cooperative skills, as each contributes to their overall success and well-being in life.",
