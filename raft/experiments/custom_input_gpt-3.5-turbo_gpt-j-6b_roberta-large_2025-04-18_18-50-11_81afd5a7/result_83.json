    "original": "The issue of privacy for famous individuals is a topic of debate, with different viewpoints on the extent to which they should be shielded from media intrusion. While some argue that being in the public eye comes with a price and invasion of privacy is inevitable, I maintain that famous people deserve enhanced privacy rights. Firstly, celebrities are entitled to privacy just like any other individual, irrespective of their public status. They should not be subjected to heightened scrutiny simply due to their fame, and the media should respect their fundamental right to privacy by refraining from intrusive behavior, such as unauthorized photography. Moreover, excessive sensationalism by the media can distort the public perception of famous individuals and harm their reputation through the dissemination of inaccurate or false information. This can lead to unwarranted public humiliation and emotional distress. Lastly, granting famous individuals more privacy can assist them in achieving a healthy work-life balance by protecting them from constant media surveillance, which can result in emotional exhaustion. Providing celebrities with the opportunity to unwind away from the public gaze is vital for their mental well-being. In summary, I advocate for increased privacy protection for famous individuals, as they are entitled to the same privacy rights as everyone else and should not be unfairly scrutinized or misrepresented by the media.",
