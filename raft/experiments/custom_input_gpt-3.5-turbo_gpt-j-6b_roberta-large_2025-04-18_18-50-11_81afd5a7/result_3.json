    "original": "Modern technology, exemplified by the internet, has significantly transformed the way information is accessed and shared, raising the question of whether it will eventually supplant books and written text as the primary sources of information. However, I hold the viewpoint that books and written materials will persist as substantial reservoirs of knowledge, unswayed by the advent of technology. Books have stood the test of time as reliable sources of information, a trend unlikely to wane in the foreseeable future. Books, along with magazines and newspapers, remain prominent sources of information, enduringly relevant in the digital age. The tangibility of books offers a unique experience, allowing readers to interact physically with the text, annotate, and engage deeply with the content—an aspect that cannot be replicated digitally. Furthermore, books provide a gateway to in-depth exploration of subjects and grant immediate access to information without the need for online searches. In contrast, the ever-evolving nature of the internet poses challenges in discerning credible sources amidst a sea of information that lacks stability and permanence. Despite the vast information available online, the internet's transient and constantly changing nature renders it ill-suited for long-term research endeavors. Hence, I maintain that books and written text will endure as reliable and immersive sources of knowledge, standing resilient against the dynamic landscape of modern technology.",
