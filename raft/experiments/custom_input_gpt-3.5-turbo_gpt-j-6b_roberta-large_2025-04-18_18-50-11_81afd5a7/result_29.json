    "original": "Our current society is characterized by the prevalent use of single-use products that are quickly discarded after one use. This trend has led to detrimental effects on the environment, particularly through the accumulation of plastic waste that poses long-lasting consequences. Plastic bags, for instance, are used for a brief period before being disposed of, ultimately accumulating in landfills, oceans, and natural habitats where they harm wildlife and ecosystems. The slow decomposition rate of plastic bags exacerbates this issue, as they persist in the environment indefinitely. Additionally, the proliferation of fast fashion has fueled our throw-away culture, as garments are mass-produced and swiftly discarded, contributing to textile waste that is challenging to manage and dispose of. The environmental impact of producing these disposable clothes is also substantial, requiring significant resources such as water and energy. Moreover, the reliance on single-use items like disposable cups and cutlery has further perpetuated our throw-away society, resulting in increased waste production, especially of non-biodegradable plastics that degrade slowly over time. To mitigate the adverse effects of our throw-away society, it is imperative to adopt sustainable practices such as recycling and composting, while reducing the use of single-use items and promoting eco-friendly alternatives to safeguard the environment for future generations.",
