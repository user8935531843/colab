As such, requiring students to enroll in courses outside their field of study is imperative in cultivating their critical thinking abilities, problem-solving skills, and expanding their knowledge base beyond their specialization. Exposure to a diverse range of subjects enables students to explore novel topics and connections that they may have overlooked, fostering a holistic understanding of the world and offering fresh perspectives within their discipline. Additionally, engaging in interdisciplinary courses nurtures essential skills like critical thinking, creativity, and problem-solving, empowering students to develop innovative solutions across various domains. This multifaceted approach to learning not only enhances graduates' competitiveness in the job market but also equips them with the versatility to apply their knowledge across different sectors. Embracing a curriculum that extends beyond one's major contributes to a well-rounded education, enabling students to contribute meaningfully to society and effectively navigate a complex and interconnected global landscape. Consequently, universities play a pivotal role in shaping well-rounded graduates who are equipped to thrive in an ever-evolving world by mandating a diverse educational experience.",
