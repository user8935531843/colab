    "original": "The 20th century witnessed a substantial surge in the number of cars on the road, with the United States seeing a significant increase from a mere few thousand cars in 1900 to over 200 million in 2000. However, the forthcoming two decades are poised to observe a decline in the prevalence of cars in use, attributable to several factors. Primarily, the escalating costs of cars, which have risen from an average of $20,000 in 2000 to $30,000 in 2020, are projected to impede accessibility for prospective buyers, with advancements in technology and safety features contributing to this price surge. Concurrently, the global urbanization trend, which forecasts 70% of the world's populace residing in cities by 2030, will diminish the necessity for private vehicle ownership, as public transit systems, walking, and cycling emerge as more feasible alternatives. Additionally, the advent of self-driving cars, already undergoing trials by various companies, is expected to become mainstream over the next two decades, offering a more economical and reliable mode of transportation. The proliferation of self-driving cars will lessen the need for individual car ownership, as users can easily hail a self-driving car when required. In conclusion, the projected decrease in cars in circulation over the next twenty years is underpinned by rising costs, urbanization trends, and the increasing prevalence of self-driving cars, fostering positive outcomes for environmental conservation and public well-being.",
