    "original": "In the future, there will likely be a decrease in the number of cars in use compared to the present. This projection is supported by several factors. Firstly, society is moving towards a more sustainable lifestyle, with individuals opting for alternative modes of transportation to reduce the environmental impact of cars. The rise in popularity of ride-sharing services like Uber and Lyft, along with investments in public transport, are indicators of this shift. Moreover, the increasing costs associated with owning and maintaining a car, such as rising fuel prices and insurance premiums, as well as expensive repairs for older vehicles, are prompting individuals to consider purchasing used cars or exploring car-free lifestyles. Additionally, advancements in technology, such as electric scooters and self-driving cars, are providing convenient alternatives to traditional car ownership. Lastly, the younger generation's preference for urban living and access to various transportation options like bike-sharing and ride-sharing services further support the notion of a decrease in the number of cars on the road in the coming decades. Overall, the convergence of sustainability trends, economic factors, technological advancements, and shifting consumer attitudes suggests a plausible decrease in the reliance on cars over the next twenty years.",
