    "original": "Numerous factors influence an individual's enjoyment of life, with age being a significant determinant. Typically, younger individuals exhibit higher levels of life satisfaction compared to their older counterparts. Various reasons contribute to this disparity. Firstly, younger individuals tend to be more physically active, possessing higher energy levels and engaging in a wider range of activities such as late-night socializing, hiking, or sports. Their enhanced physical fitness enables them to partake in endeavors that older individuals may find challenging. Secondly, youth is often accompanied by optimism, as younger individuals have not experienced as many setbacks and retain a belief in limitless possibilities and a brighter future. Conversely, older individuals may become more cynical and pessimistic due to life's adversities. Lastly, younger individuals are typically more social, surrounded by peers in educational or early career settings, fostering new relationships and experiences. In contrast, older individuals may face increased isolation post-retirement and when children move out, limiting opportunities for social interactions and new discoveries. While exceptions exist to these generalizations, the overall trend indicates that younger individuals tend to derive more enjoyment from life compared to their older counterparts.",
