    "original": "In the contemporary digital age, the shift towards electronic media is evident, leading to a decline in the use of traditional paper-based artifacts like holiday greeting cards. Environmentalists advocate for the adoption of electronic cards as a more sustainable alternative to paper cards. However, there exists a viewpoint that electronic cards lack the emotional depth and functionality of their paper counterparts. While I agree with this perspective to some extent, in this essay, I will elaborate on the reasons behind this stance. Firstly, paper cards offer a sensory experience that electronic cards cannot replicate. The tactile feel of the cardstock, the aroma of ink, and the vibrant design of the card collectively create a unique sensory experience that electronic cards cannot emulate. The tangible nature of paper cards allows recipients to physically interact with them, imbuing the greeting with a personal touch. Furthermore, paper cards can serve as keepsakes, allowing individuals to revisit them years later, fostering nostalgia and sentimental value that electronic cards lack. On the contrary, electronic cards offer convenience and efficiency. With just a few clicks, individuals can send electronic cards to a large audience, making them ideal for individuals with busy schedules who are unable to visit everyone personally. Additionally, electronic cards are more environmentally friendly, as they do not contribute to deforestation or landfills. Nevertheless, electronic cards fall short in terms of functionality compared to paper cards. Paper cards can double as decorative items, serving as wall hangings or shelf displays, and can be repurposed as bookmarks or notes, a functionality that electronic cards lack. Moreover, the personalization of paper cards through handwritten messages adds a more intimate touch to the greeting, enhancing the emotional connection between sender and recipient. In conclusion, both paper and electronic cards have their own set of advantages and drawbacks. While electronic cards offer practicality and sustainability, paper cards provide a sensory experience and functional versatility that electronic cards cannot match. Ultimately, the choice between paper and electronic cards boils down to individual preferences and values.",
