    "original": "I concur with the assertion that young individuals today are preoccupied with their personal lives rather than being attentive to global affairs. However, I hold the belief that this behavior is beneficial as it fosters a heightened awareness of community issues and prompts proactive engagement. This heightened awareness is particularly apparent when addressing matters that directly impact them, such as environmental concerns, economic challenges, or healthcare access. It is noteworthy that these issues transcend generational boundaries and affect individuals of all ages. For instance, individuals from my generation grew up amidst the Cold War era, marked by the looming threat of nuclear warfare. This exposure instilled a sense of urgency in understanding the dangers posed by nuclear weapons and the necessity of safeguarding against such threats. Present-day circumstances present a shift in the geopolitical landscape, with multiple countries possessing the capacity to launch nuclear attacks, raising uncertainties regarding national security. Without vigilance, future generations may inhabit a more precarious world. To prevent this, parental guidance and educational institutions must equip young individuals with knowledge about contemporary threats, empowering them to contribute towards safeguarding themselves and their communities.",
