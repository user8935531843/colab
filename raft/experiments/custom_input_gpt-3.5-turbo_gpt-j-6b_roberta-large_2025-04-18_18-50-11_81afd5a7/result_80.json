While some argue that patriotism can serve as a source of motivation and unity, others contend that excessive patriotism may hinder innovation and forward-thinking. In my perspective, while patriotism may at times lead to stagnation, its overall influence on progress remains positive. It is essential to acknowledge the role of patriotism in driving advancements.
