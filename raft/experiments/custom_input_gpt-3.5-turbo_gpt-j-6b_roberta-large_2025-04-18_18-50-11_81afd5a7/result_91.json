    "original": "Although the purpose of university education sparks debates, I believe it extends beyond mere workforce preparation. University education serves as a catalyst in shaping individuals' character, fostering critical thinking, effective communication, and holistic personal development. By offering diverse extracurricular activities like sports, arts, and cultural clubs, universities nurture social skills, leadership qualities, and a sense of community, laying the foundation for success in various life domains, including professional settings.
