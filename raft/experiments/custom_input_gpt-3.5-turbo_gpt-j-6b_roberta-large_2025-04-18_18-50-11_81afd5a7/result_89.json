    "original": "The debate between having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects versus specializing in a specific subject has long been a contentious topic, with valid arguments on both sides. Personally, I advocate for the importance of having broad knowledge across multiple academic disciplines. In today's rapidly evolving world, predicting the future demands in terms of knowledge and skills is increasingly challenging. For instance, the emergence of social media as a vital component of various professions was unforeseeable in the past. Without a diverse academic background, individuals may lack the necessary competencies for adapting to evolving professional requirements. Furthermore, possessing a broad understanding of various subjects cultivates well-rounded individuals, enabling them to appreciate diverse perspectives and comprehend differing viewpoints. By exploring history from various global perspectives, individuals can gain a more accurate understanding of past events, avoiding a narrow and biased worldview rooted solely in their own national context. Lastly, having a wide knowledge base makes it easier to acquire new skills and information. For example, learning a new language becomes more manageable when one already has a foundation in another language, as existing language structures serve as a framework for understanding. Similarly, familiarity with diverse cultures facilitates the learning process when exploring new cultural realms. In summary, I firmly believe that possessing a broad knowledge base across various academic subjects offers numerous advantages compared to specializing in a single subject.",
