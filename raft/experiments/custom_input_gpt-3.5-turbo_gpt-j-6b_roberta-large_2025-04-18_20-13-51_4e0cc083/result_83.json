    "original": "When learning English, the importance of reading and speaking skills is a topic of debate among many individuals. However, for Chinese learners, I believe that speaking holds greater significance. This is primarily due to the nature of Chinese as a tonal language, where the meaning of words can vary based on the tone used. Without a focus on speaking, Chinese learners may struggle to grasp the nuances of English pronunciation and meaning. Furthermore, the complexity of the Chinese language, with a multitude of characters each carrying specific meanings, can pose challenges for learners who solely focus on reading. By prioritizing speaking skills, Chinese learners can gain a deeper understanding of the language and communicate effectively. While reading is valuable for expanding vocabulary and laying a foundation for speaking, the ability to speak fluently and engage in real-life interactions is paramount. Overall, speaking is more essential for Chinese learners when it comes to mastering English, providing practical and immediate benefits for communication and social interaction.",
