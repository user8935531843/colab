    "original": "There is no definitive answer as to which skill of English is more important for Chinese learners, with some advocating for reading while others prioritize speaking. In my opinion, speaking is more crucial due to several reasons. Firstly, spoken English is the most natural form of the language, aiding in understanding nuances and subtleties. Secondly, spoken English is versatile, applicable to various scenarios from face-to-face communication to business presentations. Lastly, speaking is essential for practical reasons such as travel, work, and living in English-speaking countries. However, reading remains an essential skill for improving vocabulary, grammar, and gaining a deeper understanding of the language. While both skills are important, speaking takes precedence for its real-world application, fluency improvement, and cultural immersion opportunities.",
