    "original": "The primary function of a university education remains a topic of debate, with varying perspectives on its purpose. While some argue that universities are primarily meant to equip students for future employment opportunities, others contend that they serve broader functions such as cultivating intellect and preparing individuals for leadership roles. In my opinion, universities should serve a diverse array of purposes, encompassing employment preparation, civic engagement, and lifelong learning. Employment readiness is undeniably a crucial aspect of a university education, providing students with essential skills and knowledge for success in their chosen careers. Additionally, universities should instill a sense of civic responsibility in students by fostering active citizenship and leadership skills.

Ultimately, the purpose of a university education may vary depending on individual goals and aspirations, with the potential to encompass a holistic approach that prepares students for multifaceted success in their professional and personal lives.",
