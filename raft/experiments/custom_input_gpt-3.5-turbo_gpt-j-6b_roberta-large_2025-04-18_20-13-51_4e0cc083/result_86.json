    "original": "The debate over whether reading or speaking skills are more important for Chinese learners of English is a common one. While both skills hold value, I firmly believe that speaking takes precedence for several key reasons. Firstly, speaking is more vital for daily interactions as it is the primary mode of communication in various settings. From conversing with friends and family to conducting business transactions, spoken language plays a crucial role in our daily lives. Conversely, written language is primarily used for specific tasks like reading books or composing emails. Therefore, Chinese learners aiming to integrate English into their daily routines should prioritize honing their speaking abilities. Additionally, speaking serves as a better gauge of fluency as it challenges individuals to actively produce language, showcasing a higher level of proficiency compared to passive reading comprehension. Therefore, Chinese learners seeking to evaluate their English fluency should focus on enhancing their speaking skills. Lastly, speaking reigns supreme as the most effective approach to learning a new language, encouraging learners to engage actively in dialogue and conversation. This natural, active language use inherently fosters a deeper understanding and fluency, making speaking a foundational aspect of language acquisition. In conclusion, I advocate for the prioritization of speaking skills over reading for Chinese learners of English, emphasizing the pivotal role that spoken language plays in daily interactions, fluency assessment, and overall language acquisition.",
