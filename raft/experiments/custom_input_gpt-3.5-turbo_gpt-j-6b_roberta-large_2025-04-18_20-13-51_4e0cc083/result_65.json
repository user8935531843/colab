    "original": "There is ongoing debate regarding the treatment of famous people by the media, with some arguing that celebrities deserve more privacy and protection from invasive scrutiny. This viewpoint highlights the unfairness of continuous public exposure and scrutiny, particularly in regards to celebrities' personal lives.
