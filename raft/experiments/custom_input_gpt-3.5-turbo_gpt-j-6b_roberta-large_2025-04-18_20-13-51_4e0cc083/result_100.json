    "original": "Work in modern society is undoubtedly more stressful and demanding compared to the past, primarily due to the increase in workload and the lack of leisure time. The current work environment is characterized by long hours, constant overtime, and a lack of relaxation opportunities, making it challenging for individuals to find time for leisure activities. While some argue that the urgency of tasks in today's society necessitates such demanding work schedules, others view work as a hindrance to quality of life and leisure. It is difficult to ascertain which perspective is correct, as opinions on the matter vary over time. Personally, I believe that work is integral to today's societal structure, providing individuals with purpose and opportunities for personal growth. However, the current work landscape, marked by extended work hours and minimal breaks, contributes to heightened stress levels and limited leisure time. Factors such as increased focus on profit maximization, economic instability, and heightened focus on work over personal well-being have collectively intensified the stress associated with work in contemporary society. Despite the importance of work in today's economy, the emphasis on productivity and efficiency has led to a more demanding and stressful work environment, limiting opportunities for relaxation and leisure activities.",
