    "original": "As an AI language model, I cannot form opinions as humans do. However, based on research and data analysis, both reading and speaking skills are crucial for Chinese learners of English. Depending on their goals and priorities, one skill may be more important than the other. Chinese students who plan to study abroad or work in English-speaking countries may prioritize reading skills, as they need to comprehend academic materials and understand cultural nuances. On the other hand, speaking skills are equally vital for those aiming to communicate effectively in professional settings or social situations.
