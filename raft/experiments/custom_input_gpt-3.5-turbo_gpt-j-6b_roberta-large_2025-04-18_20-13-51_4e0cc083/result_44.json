    "original": "The idea of teaching children the importance of cooperation as opposed to competition is a topic that garners varied opinions among educators and parents. While some advocate for teaching children to compete to foster independence and self-reliance, others argue in favor of teaching cooperation to help build relationships and cultivate teamwork skills.
