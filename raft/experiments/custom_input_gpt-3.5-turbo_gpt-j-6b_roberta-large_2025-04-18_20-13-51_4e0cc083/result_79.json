    "original": "Computer games have sparked debate regarding their influence on children's physical, intellectual, and psychological development. Detractors argue that the negative impacts outweigh the positives, urging preventive measures. Conversely, proponents assert that computer games offer benefits that should not be overlooked. For physical development, active games promote physical activity and enhance hand-eye coordination and motor skills. Moreover, intellectual development is fostered through problem-solving and critical thinking skills in games, with educational games augmenting knowledge in various subjects. Psychological well-being is also supported by reducing stress and anxiety, boosting self-esteem, and social skills development in multiplayer games. Thus, an open-minded approach considering the type of game, playtime, and individual characteristics is vital to maximize benefits while minimizing risks. Consequently, promoting responsible gaming habits and parental supervision are key to harnessing the positive effects of computer games on children's development.",
