    "original": "The debated topic of computer games' impact on children's development has sparked numerous discussions worldwide. Some argue that these games have a negative influence on young individuals, asserting that children are ill-prepared for the consequences of gaming. They advocate for children to engage in age-appropriate activities such as reading, socializing with friends, and participating in sports, rather than playing computer games. In a recent survey conducted by the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press, 63% of respondents believed that video games were detrimental to children. This sentiment was more prevalent among men, with 69% in agreement compared to 57% of women. Notably, 56% of those who viewed gaming negatively deemed it to be significantly harmful, further indicating their concerns about the impact of gaming on youth. The survey also explored respondents' perspectives on strategies to address the potential harms of gaming. While 44% agreed that parents should educate children on responsible device usage, a significant portion (33%) did not support this notion. However, when it came to prohibiting children from playing computer games, a higher percentage (45%) approved of this restrictive measure. Ultimately, the debate surrounding the effects of computer games on children underscores the importance of considering individual needs and preferences. While some may argue for the prohibition of gaming among children, others emphasize the significance of addressing the potential negative impacts through education and responsible usage. It is crucial to recognize the diverse views and approaches to navigating the complexities of children's engagement with computer games.",
