    "original": "The debate over whether reading or speaking English is more important for Chinese learners has been ongoing for many years. Some people argue that reading is more crucial, as it provides a strong foundation for developing English skills and understanding vocabulary and grammar. Reading also exposes learners to English culture and society, which is beneficial for future career opportunities. Conversely, others believe that speaking English takes precedence, as it allows learners to interact with English-speaking individuals, hone language skills, and gain insight into English culture. The ability to communicate effectively in English is essential for various settings, such as business or social interactions. Ultimately, both reading and speaking skills are vital for Chinese learners, as they contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the English language and facilitate communication in diverse situations. It is recommended that learners focus on developing both skills to achieve proficiency in English and meet their individual learning goals.",
