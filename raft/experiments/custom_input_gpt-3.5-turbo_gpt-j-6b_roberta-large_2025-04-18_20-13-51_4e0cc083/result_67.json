    "original": "There is a debate surrounding the media's depiction of famous individuals, with some advocating for more privacy and others arguing that it comes with the territory of fame. Proponents of increased privacy assert that celebrities, despite their renown, are entitled to personal lives shielded from incessant media glare. Conversely, individuals in the public eye consciously opt for a career marked by exposure and should expect scrutiny. This discussion lacks a definitive solution due to conflicting viewpoints. However, maintaining a balance between respecting celebrities' privacy rights and fulfilling the media's mandate to inform the public is essential in navigating this complex issue. Ultimately, while celebrities should anticipate being treated differently by the media, some discretion in reporting personal aspects is warranted to uphold their dignity and well-being.",
