    "original": "There are differing views on the primary function of a university education. Some argue that universities should primarily focus on preparing students for employment, while others believe that universities have broader functions. I hold the view that universities serve multiple important functions beyond simply preparing students for the job market. Firstly, university education offers students the opportunity to delve into various subjects in depth, fostering a well-rounded knowledge base irrespective of career outcomes. Secondly, universities provide a platform for socialization and networking, crucial for personal growth and professional connections. Additionally, universities serve as a gateway to further education, paving the way for postgraduate studies or specialized fields. While employment readiness is an important consideration for many university students, I believe that a university education fulfills several vital roles beyond this primary function. Universities aim to equip students with a diverse skill set, impart critical thinking abilities, expose them to different cultures, and foster a sense of community through extracurricular engagements.",
