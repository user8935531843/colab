    "original": "Computer games have been utilized as educational tools to engage and entertain children. Nevertheless, concerns have been raised regarding the potential negative impacts of computer games on children's physical, intellectual, and psychological development. Critics argue that computer games may have outweighed negative effects compared to positive ones, necessitating preventative measures to restrict children's access to them. Computer games have the potential to be addictive and engrossing, diverting children's attention from reality and affecting their learning and exploratory behaviors. Additionally, the nature of violent content within computer games can pose a threat to children's mental well-being. The immersion in computer games can also lead to distractions and hindered focus, consequently impacting children's academic performance. Furthermore, excessive exposure to computer games can result in problematic behaviors and disciplinary issues, potentially disrupting social interactions and school performance. To mitigate these concerns, parents must recognize the risks associated with computer games and establish guidelines to ensure safe and moderated usage. Implementing limitations on gaming time can prevent addiction and promote a healthy balance between gaming and other activities, safeguarding children from negative consequences on their physical, intellectual, and psychological well-being.",
