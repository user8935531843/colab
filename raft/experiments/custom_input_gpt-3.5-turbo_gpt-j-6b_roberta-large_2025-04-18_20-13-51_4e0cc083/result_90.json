    "original": "Education is a valuable investment that can be costly, but the repercussions of not obtaining an education, particularly in a globally connected world, can be even more detrimental. There are various factors contributing to the high cost of education, such as the financial resources required, the time and effort needed to acquire knowledge, and the challenges of securing employment post-graduation. Moreover, many professions necessitate a college degree, further adding to the financial burden. Apart from the monetary aspect, not having a college degree can limit job opportunities, particularly in industries like healthcare and business.

In a world where education is a key determinant of success, the costs associated with obtaining it and the consequences of lacking it underscore the importance of investing in one's education for future prospects.",
