    "original": "The debate surrounding whether famous individuals should be granted greater privacy has long been a contentious one. Some argue that famous figures deserve more privacy as they are human beings who should not be under constant scrutiny. Others contend that the price of fame includes a lack of privacy, and celebrities should be prepared to accept this reality. In my view, I believe that famous people should indeed be afforded more privacy, and I will elaborate on my reasoning in this essay. Firstly, it is essential to recognize that famous individuals are still human and should be treated with the same respect and privacy as anyone else. They should not be subjected to relentless scrutiny and criticism from the media, allowing them the freedom to live their lives without fear of judgment for every action they take. This is especially critical for young celebrities who are still developing and should not be subjected to harsh criticism that often accompanies fame. Moreover, providing famous individuals with privacy is crucial in safeguarding their mental well-being. The media can be harsh and detrimental to a person's mental health, with constant criticism and surveillance potentially leading to anxiety, depression, and other mental health issues. It is vital to allow celebrities the space they need to protect their mental health. Lastly, famous individuals should be granted privacy to shield their personal lives. They should be able to maintain the privacy of their personal affairs and not have to worry about the media encroaching on their private moments. This is particularly crucial for celebrities with families, as they deserve the opportunity to safeguard their loved ones' privacy without the intrusion of the media. In conclusion, I firmly believe that famous individuals should be given more privacy. They are entitled to the same respect as any other individual and should not be continuously subjected to scrutiny and criticism by the media. Furthermore, it is imperative to prioritize their mental well-being and personal lives, thereby justifying the need for celebrities to be granted additional privacy.",
