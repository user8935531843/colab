    "original": "The popularity of computer games among children worldwide has raised concerns regarding their impact on physical, intellectual, and psychological development. While some argue that computer games have more negative effects than positive ones, I believe that the positives outweigh the negatives, and thus preventive measures should not be enforced to restrict children from playing them. On the negative side, excessive gaming can lead to physical health issues such as obesity and vision problems. Additionally, prolonged exposure to violent games may result in aggressive behavior and academic underperformance. However, computer games also offer positive outcomes. They can enhance problem-solving skills, hand-eye coordination, and social interactions. Moreover, they provide a sense of accomplishment and cultural enrichment. Despite the concerns over detrimental impacts, the benefits of computer games in fostering cognitive and social abilities in children are significant. Therefore, I believe that children should be allowed to engage in computer games in moderation without excessive restrictions.",
