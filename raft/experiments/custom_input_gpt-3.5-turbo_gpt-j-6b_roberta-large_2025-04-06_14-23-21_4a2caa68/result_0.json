    "original": "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees and place the cookie dough in the microwave. Roll out the dough into a 1-inch circle, about 2 inches from the center of the dough. Cut the cookies into 5-inch squares. Using a fork, slice each cookie into 1/2 inch cubes. Brush one cookie with the butter mixture; set aside. Mix together the cream cheese and sugar until well blended. Stir in the flour and salt. Spoon the melted butter over each cookie. Roll out two pieces of dough onto the cookie sheet. Place them on a lightly floured surface and fold down half way. Remove the cookie sheets when the edges are fully folded up so that they will not slide or slip off the cookie sheet during baking. Bake for 8 minutes or until golden brown and lightly oiled. Let cool completely before cutting into slices. Paste the cookies onto a greased 9×13 baking pan. When you see red circles around the edges of each piece, remove the pans from the oven immediately and cut through",
