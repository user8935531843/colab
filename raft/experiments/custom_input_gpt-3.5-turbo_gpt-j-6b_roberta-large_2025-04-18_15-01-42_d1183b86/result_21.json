    "original": "In this study, we introduce a linear Vlasov solver that accurately predicts the microbunching gain in electron beams, considering the impact of Coherent Synchrotron Radiation (CSR), Longitudinal Space Charge (LSC), and geometric impedances in the linear accelerator (linac). Microbunching, characterized by periodic density fluctuations in an electron beam, plays a pivotal role in enhancing the performance of radiation sources like Free Electron Lasers (FELs). Precise estimation of microbunching gain is essential for optimizing the efficiency of these radiation sources. Our solver, founded on a robust matrix approach, efficiently computes microbunching gain based on beam characteristics and machine lattice configuration. Through comparisons with particle tracking simulations and experimental data from the Linac Coherent Light Source-II (LCLS-II) at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, we validate the effectiveness of our solver. Our findings demonstrate a high level of agreement with simulations and experiments across diverse machine and beam conditions, showcasing the solver's potential in advancing the understanding and optimization of microbunching gain for FELs and related radiation sources.",
