    "original": "We introduce a quantum circuit that generates a state representing the quantum entanglement of prime numbers less than 2^n, utilizing Grover's algorithm with a quantum version of the Miller-Rabin primality test as the oracle. This entangled Prime state encodes number-theoretical functions like the distribution of twin primes and the Chebyshev bias. By incorporating the quantum Fourier transform, this algorithm can efficiently estimate the prime counting function with an error margin below the threshold necessary for verifying the Riemann hypothesis. Additionally, we propose a Twin Prime state to assess the quantity of twin primes and another state to explore the Goldbach conjecture. These quantum algorithms offer a promising avenue for experimentally validating the arithmetic properties of prime numbers on quantum systems.",
