    "original": "SSD (Single Shot Multibox Detector) is renowned for its exceptional accuracy and rapid processing speed, although its reliance on features from shallow layers, particularly Conv4_3, hampers its performance in detecting small objects. Addressing this limitation, this paper introduces DDSSD (Dilation and Deconvolution Single Shot Multibox Detector), an advanced iteration of SSD featuring a novel feature fusion module that enhances small object detection capabilities. The feature fusion module leverages dilation convolution to expand the receptive field of shallow layer features and incorporates deconvolution to augment the size of high layer feature maps. The proposed network achieves impressive results, boasting a 79.7% mean Average Precision (mAP) on the PASCAL VOC2007 test and a 28.3% mean mAP on the MS COCO test-dev dataset while operating at 41 frames per second (FPS) with just a 300x300 input on a single Nvidia 1080 GPU. Notably, DDSSD demonstrates significant improvements in small object detection, achieving a 10.5% increase on MS COCO and a remarkable 22.8% boost on the FLIR thermal dataset, outperforming numerous state-of-the-art object detection algorithms in terms of accuracy and speed.",
