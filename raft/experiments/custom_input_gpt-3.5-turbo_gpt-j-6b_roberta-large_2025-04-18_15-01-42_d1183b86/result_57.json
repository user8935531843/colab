    "original": "The internal structure of stars and interstellar clouds is a focal point of classical and relativistic physics, with extensive research exploring the influence of General Relativity on this structure. This article introduces a prototype model within the realm of General Relativity, assuming that stars are composed of polytropic gas. This assumption is justified by the fact that stars undergo irreversible thermodynamic processes, releasing heat and radiation into space. Employing an idealized polytropic gas model facilitates the investigation of interior solutions to the Einstein equations of General Relativity. By deriving a unified equation for the cumulative mass distribution of the star and utilizing the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation, formulas for the isentropic index and coefficient are determined. Analytical and numerical solutions for the polytropic structure of self-gravitating stars are presented, along with an examination of their stability. Additionally, it is demonstrated that knowledge of the thermodynamic properties of a star, represented by the isentropic index and coefficient, uniquely determines the matter density within the star.",
