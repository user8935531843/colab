    "original": "We present findings on the Equation of State in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) at non-zero chemical potentials associated with conserved charges, using a Taylor expansion up to sixth order in baryon number, electric charge, and strangeness chemical potentials. Strangeness neutrality and a fixed electric charge to baryon number ratio constrain the electric charge and strangeness chemical potentials. Our computations utilize the Highly Improved Staggered Quarks (HISQ) discretization scheme at physical quark masses and varying lattice spacings to manage lattice cut-off effects. We also evaluate the pressure along lines of constant energy density, serving as proxies for freeze-out conditions, and examine its dependence on $\\mu_B$ for hydrodynamic modeling near freezeout. Additionally, we determine the radius of convergence of the Taylor series through the 6th order coefficients, providing insights into the critical end-point's positioning in the T-$\\mu_B$ plane of the QCD phase diagram.",
