    "original": "The integration of energy storage systems (ESS) into the smart grid has emerged as a key solution to the challenges posed by the growing reliance on renewable energy sources. Despite rapid advancements in ESS technology, the lack of a structured framework for evaluating and deploying energy storage systems hinders their seamless integration into the smart grid. This paper proposes a prospect theoretic approach for the integration of ESS into the smart grid, leveraging prospect theory to address decision biases and risk perceptions influencing the assessment of ESS projects. The approach involves three key phases: (i) identifying decision-makers' attitudes and risk perceptions towards ESS projects, (ii) assessing the economic and technical feasibility of ESS projects, and (iii) developing a decision-making framework for integrating ESS projects into the smart grid. A real-world case study on integrating energy storage into a microgrid showcases the efficacy of the prospect theoretic approach, demonstrating its utility in aiding decision-makers in meeting the escalating demand for renewable energy and managing the uncertainties associated with ESS integration into the smart grid.",
