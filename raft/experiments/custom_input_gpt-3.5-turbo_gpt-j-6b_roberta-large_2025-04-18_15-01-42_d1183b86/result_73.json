    "original": "In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, traditional public health monitoring methods have faced unprecedented challenges, necessitating the establishment of more robust and adaptable surveillance systems. Despite the availability of real-time data, delayed reporting from various regions poses a significant hurdle to accurate forecasting and response efforts. To address this issue, this study proposes a novel regional now- and forecasting methodology that integrates machine learning and statistical techniques. By leveraging an ensemble modeling approach, we strive to predict both current and future trajectories of COVID-19 infections at a regional level. Through a retrospective analysis of historical data and comparison with existing models, we showcase the efficacy of our approach in enhancing forecasting accuracy. Our findings underscore the importance of considering regional infection dynamics and accounting for reporting delays to optimize resource allocation in pandemic control efforts. This methodology holds promise for enhancing infectious disease surveillance systems and guiding informed decision-making by policymakers and public health authorities.",
