    "original": "The study of brain functional architecture through network analysis is gaining traction, highlighting the dynamic nature of functional networks, particularly in fMRI applications. While traditional approaches assume stationary networks, recent findings indicate the non-stationary connectivity of brain regions even during rest. Therefore, novel brain imaging techniques are required to capture the dynamic aspects of fMRI data comprehensively. The Smooth Incremental Graphical Lasso Estimation (SINGLE) algorithm is proposed to estimate dynamic brain networks from fMRI data. Applied to functional MRI data from 24 healthy individuals performing a cognitive task, the SINGLE algorithm reveals dynamic changes in network structure associated with attention-demanding tasks. Using graph theoretic metrics, the study identifies the Right Inferior Frontal Gyrus as dynamically modulating with task engagement, shedding light on its role in attention and executive function during cognitive tasks. The findings suggest a crucial role for the Right Inferior Frontal Gyrus in regulating interactions between brain regions, particularly in tasks requiring cognitive control.",
