    "original": "The stability of force-free magnetic fields is crucial for the formation of various astrophysical structures, such as magnetic loops and filaments. This study explores the stability of a force-free surface that separates magnetized regions from a vacuum gap, utilizing the principle of minimum energy to establish a variational formulation. Through a small perturbation analysis, the study demonstrates the stability of the force-free surface under specific conditions. The stability is identified to be influenced by the pressure and magnetic field profiles within the magnetized regions encompassing the force-free surface. These findings shed light on the stability characteristics of force-free magnetic fields in vacuum gaps, offering valuable insights for comprehending astrophysical phenomena like solar flares and coronal mass ejections. The theoretical framework presented in this research can be extended to diverse physical systems, including laboratory plasma experiments and fusion devices.",
