    "original": "Spectral graph filters have garnered significant interest in signal processing, computer vision, and machine learning domains in recent years. However, the challenge of transferring spectral graph filters across diverse datasets and domains remains a key concern. This study explores the transferability of four prevalent spectral graph filtering techniques across various datasets, including social and biological networks. Our analysis focuses on evaluating the robustness, stability, and generalization capabilities of spectral graph filters across different datasets. The findings suggest that spectral graph filters demonstrate varying degrees of transferability across datasets, influenced by the specific filtering method and dataset under consideration. Additionally, we find that incorporating domain-specific information, such as node features or labels, can enhance transferability performance. This research provides valuable insights into the generalizability of spectral graph filtering methods and highlights potential avenues for further investigation and development in this field.",
