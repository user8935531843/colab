    "original": "A critical analysis is presented on the outcomes obtained for baryon electromagnetic and axial form factors from relativistic constituent quark models within the framework of Poincaré-invariant quantum mechanics, with a primary focus on the point-form approach. The study begins by outlining the forecasts of the Goldstone-boson-exchange constituent quark model for the electroweak structure of nucleons utilizing a spectator-model current in point form. Subsequently, the impacts of diverse dynamics inherent in various types of constituent quark models (such as Goldstone-boson-exchange, one-gluon-exchange, and instanton-induced interactions) are deliberated upon. The study concludes with a comparison of the point-form results with equivalent predictions computed in instant form, emphasizing the considerable impact of relativistic effects. The analysis disregards a nonrelativistic approach, while pinpointing notable shortcomings in the instant-form outcomes. Only the point-form results within the spectator-model approximation for the current demonstrate a reasonable a-priori standpoint, demonstrating a commendable correlation with experimental data, especially for the Goldstone-boson-exchange constituent quark model.",
