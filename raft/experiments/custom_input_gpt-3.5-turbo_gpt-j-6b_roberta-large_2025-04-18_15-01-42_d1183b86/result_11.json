    "original": "The Computational physics community has recently focused on developing techniques to enhance the computational efficiency of electronic structure calculations. Specifically, we have concentrated on accelerating the full-potential linearized augmented plane-wave (FLAPW) method on heterogeneous architectures. By leveraging Graphical Processing Units (GPUs) and employing Message Passing Interface (MPI) and OpenMP parallelization strategies, we have optimized FLAPW calculations. Our findings reveal that GPU acceleration can significantly reduce computational time for FLAPW calculations, transforming days of computation into a matter of hours, thus enabling the analysis of large systems and extended simulations. Additionally, our hybrid parallelization approach involving both MPI and OpenMP has yielded substantial speed improvements, allowing for the effective utilization of a large number of processors. Through benchmarking analysis and a detailed breakdown of computational time across various code segments, we have gained valuable insights into the efficacy of our optimization techniques. The ability to expedite the FLAPW method on heterogeneous architectures holds great promise for materials science researchers seeking to conduct in-depth electronic structure analyses for material characterization and prediction of physical properties.",
