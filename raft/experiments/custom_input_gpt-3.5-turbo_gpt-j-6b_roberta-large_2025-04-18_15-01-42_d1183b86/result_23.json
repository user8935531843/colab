    "original": "Grounded in the realm of dynamical systems theory, the concept of hypercyclicity in linear functional analysis pertains to the action of a bounded linear operator T on a separable complex Banach space X. A bounded linear operator T is deemed hypercyclic if there exists a vector x in X, such that the orbit of x under the action of T converges densely in X. Introducing the notion of common hypercyclic vectors among a family of operators yields essential conditions for the hypercyclicity of the family. This paper offers an overview of the current state of common hypercyclic vectors, exploring different characterizations, relationships with associated operators, and connections with concepts like composition operators and invariant subspaces. Recent advancements in the field of common hypercyclic vectors are also examined, aiming to enhance the reader's comprehension of their significance in hypercyclicity theory and highlighting future research directions and unresolved inquiries within this domain.",
