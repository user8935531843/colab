    "original": "The reduced-density-matrix (RDM) theory is a valuable strategy for depicting the electronic structure of molecular systems, incorporating correlation and relaxation phenomena. The issue of size-consistency in the RDM approach has been a subject of debate within quantum chemistry. To address this concern, we delve into the origins of size inconsistencies and propose a resolution based on the unitary invariant diagonal $N$-representability conditions, which are upheld by any $N$-particle system. These conditions ensure that the RDMs of subsystems align harmoniously and can be utilized to construct the RDM of the entire system in a size-consistent manner. Furthermore, we showcase that the $N$-representability conditions can be leveraged to develop novel, efficient algorithms for computing RDMs of extensive molecules. Our computational findings indicate that our approach yields size-consistent energies for diverse chemical systems, even those with pronounced electronic correlations, and remains computationally viable for systems comprising hundreds of atoms. This study establishes a theoretical groundwork for enhancing the precision and efficiency of the RDM method, carrying significant implications for the future of quantum chemistry.",
