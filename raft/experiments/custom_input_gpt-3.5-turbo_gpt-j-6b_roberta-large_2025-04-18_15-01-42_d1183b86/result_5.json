    "original": "The exploration of semiconductor materials has paved the way for the creation of quantum dot structures with distinct optical and electrical properties, ideal for diverse applications. Our research delves into the structural attributes of InGaAs quantum dots through the utilization of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. By presenting NMR inverse spectra, we unveil the intrinsic atomic configuration of the quantum dots, furnishing comprehensive insights into their structure at the atomic level. Analyzing the NMR data, our findings accentuate the heightened sensitivity of the indium-containing layer within the quantum dots. Noteworthy features observed in the NMR spectra shed light on the emergence of interfacial defects and their interplay with other structural irregularities within the quantum dots. This study marks a significant stride in unraveling the nuanced intricacies of InGaAs quantum dot structures and the pathways leading to defect formation, pivotal for steering the development of innovative applications. Our research underscores the efficacy of NMR spectroscopy as a potent tool for scrutinizing localized structural nuances in semiconductor materials, laying a robust foundation for advancing technological innovations in the field.",
