    "original": "This study introduces a novel methodology for estimating crop primary productivity through the utilization of machine learning techniques trained with radiative transfer simulations. By merging data from Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 satellites, the study aims to enhance the precision of primary productivity estimation. The research methodology involves utilizing radiative transfer simulations to generate training datasets, which are then input into various machine learning algorithms to generate predictions for primary productivity. The study investigates multiple machine learning models, including random forests, support vector machines, and deep neural networks, and evaluates their performance using metrics such as coefficient of determination and root mean squared error. Results showcase the efficacy of the proposed approach in producing precise estimates of primary productivity, surpassing conventional methods. Moreover, the study demonstrates that combining data from Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 satellites leads to even superior outcomes. This research has the potential to significantly impact precision agriculture and crop management by providing high-resolution estimates of primary productivity on a global scale.",
