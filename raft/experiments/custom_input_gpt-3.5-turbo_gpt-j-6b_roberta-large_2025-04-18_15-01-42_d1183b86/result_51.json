    "original": "Our study delves into the scaling characteristics of bipolar outflows, inherent in the circumstellar surroundings of young stellar objects, commonly attributed to magnetohydrodynamic forces. We conduct a multifractal analysis on near-infrared light scattered by dust particles in the lobes of seven bipolar nebulae, including GGD 18, V380 Orionis, LkH\\alpha 101/NGC 1579, LkH\\alpha 233, PV Cephei, V645 Cygni (GL 2789), and V633 Cassiopeiae (LkH\\alpha 198). Our findings suggest that these objects exhibit characteristics of a multifractal universality class, with average universal parameters showing alpha= 1.96 +/- 0.02, C_1=0.04 +/- 0.02, and H=0.7 +/- 0.2, indicating similarities in the dynamics of the observed entities. Furthermore, we explore the presence of anisotropy in the scaling of GGD 18 through the use of the Generalized Scale Invariance (GSI) framework, revealing the involvement of differential rotation and stratification in the outflow mechanism. The dynamic nature of stratification implies that gravity might not be the primary stratifying force at play.",
