    "original": "This study explores the impact of Y-substitution on the structural characteristics and spin-phonon interactions in orthorhombic GdMnO$_{3}$. Through X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy, we analyze the alterations in crystal structure induced by the Y-substitution, revealing a reduction in orthorhombic distortion and an expansion of the unit cell volume. Our findings from Raman spectroscopy indicate the presence of vibrational modes linked to the Y-substitution, influencing the Mn-O and Gd-O bond lengths. By conducting magnetization measurements, we assess the magnetic properties of Y-substituted GdMnO$_{3}$, observing changes in the magnetic ground state due to the substitution. We further investigate spin-phonon coupling by examining the temperature-dependent behavior of the Raman spectra, highlighting the impact of Y-substitution on magnon-phonon interactions in GdMnO$_{3}$. Overall, our study offers valuable insights into the structural and magnetic features of Y-substituted GdMnO$_{3}, paving the way for the development of advanced materials with customized magnetic and electronic properties.",
