    "original": "In this study, we introduce a streamlined implementation of batched Kronecker product for 2-D matrices and 3-D arrays specifically designed for NVIDIA GPUs. By leveraging the parallel processing capabilities of GPU architecture, we are able to execute extensive matrix computations in a fraction of the time compared to traditional CPU-based systems. Through our experimentation with real-world datasets, we validate the superior performance of our method over existing GPU-based approaches and CPU-based implementations. Our methodology exhibits remarkable scalability, enabling swift computation of Kronecker products across sizable datasets and facilitating the analysis of intricate high-dimensional data. Moreover, we conduct a thorough analysis of the computational and memory prerequisites of our approach, demonstrating its efficiency in handling datasets comprising millions of elements. The practical implications of our method are anticipated to be profound, particularly in domains such as machine learning, image and signal processing, and scientific computing, where the calculation of Kronecker product plays a pivotal role in numerous algorithms.",
