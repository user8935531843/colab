    "original": "This research introduces a novel technique for identifying cohesive motion in videos captured by moving cameras, leveraging optical flow orientations. By considering both the camera's movement and the scene's 3D structure, the proposed method accurately estimates optical flow orientations. The approach involves constructing coherence matrices for local video patches to depict prevalent motion directions and intensities. Subsequently, a graph-based segmentation algorithm is applied to these matrices to segment regions of cohesive motion. Demonstrating superior performance compared to existing techniques, the method excels in both precision and efficiency, remaining resilient against camera jitter and lighting alterations. Notably, the approach exhibits practicality for real-time applications due to its speed. Through experiments conducted on synthetic and actual datasets, including challenging crowded scenes, the proposed method showcases its efficacy. This innovative approach has the potential to advance the field of computer vision and find applications in diverse domains such as autonomous driving, scene comprehension, and surveillance systems.",
