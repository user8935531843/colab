    "original": "Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a progressive neurological disorder characterized by symptoms such as rigidity, tremors, and postural instability. Diagnosis of PD typically relies on clinical evaluation due to the lack of definitive medical tests, leading to misdiagnoses in a significant number of cases. To address the need for accurate and efficient diagnostic methods, this study introduces LPGNet, a novel approach to diagnosing PD based on gait analysis. LPGNet leverages Linear Prediction Residuals (LPR) to identify distinctive patterns from gait data, and employs a 1D convolutional neural network with depth-wise separable convolutions for diagnosis. Achieving an impressive Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.91, LPGNet offers a substantial speedup of 21 times and requires significantly fewer parameters compared to existing state-of-the-art models. Additionally, an analysis of cross-validation strategies commonly employed in PD diagnosis highlights the presence of data leakage across folds, underscoring the importance of rigorous evaluation to avoid model overfitting and ensure reliable performance assessment for future research endeavors.",
