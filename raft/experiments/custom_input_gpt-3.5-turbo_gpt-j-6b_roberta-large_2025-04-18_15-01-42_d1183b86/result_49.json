    "original": "Recent research has showcased the possibility of enhancing noise tolerance bounds for device-independent entanglement certification and activating Bell nonlocality by broadcasting the subsystems of a bipartite quantum state. In this study, we build upon these findings to delve deeper into this phenomenon. Firstly, we establish new insights concerning the activation of Bell nonlocality by devising tailored Bell inequalities for the broadcast scenario, leading to heightened levels of Bell nonlocality activation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that bipartite states capable of being explained by a local hidden-variable model under general measurements can exhibit genuine tripartite nonlocal correlations through broadcasting. Additionally, we investigate device-independent entanglement certification in the broadcast scenario and demonstrate the feasibility of this certification for the two-qubit Werner state across a wide range of entanglement levels using semidefinite programming techniques. Lastly, we extend the concept of EPR steering to the broadcast scenario and offer fresh examples of activating the two-qubit isotropic state. These findings lay the groundwork for the development of broadcast-based device-dependent and semi-device-independent protocols in the field of quantum physics.",
