    "original": "The emergence of spatiotemporal data across diverse domains has necessitated the development of advanced statistical learning methods capable of capturing spatial and temporal relationships. This paper introduces the R package Mlr3spatiotempcv, which offers a suite of resampling techniques for evaluating the effectiveness of machine learning models designed to incorporate spatiotemporal information. The package encompasses various spatial and temporal cross-validation methods, such as the block bootstrap and sliding window approaches, suitable for regression, classification, and survival analysis tasks. Additionally, Mlr3spatiotempcv streamlines processes like spatiotemporal feature selection and hyperparameter tuning through user-friendly interfaces, pivotal for optimizing model performance. Leveraging R's parallel computing capabilities, the package enables efficient computation of resampling-based performance metrics. In essence, Mlr3spatiotempcv enhances the functionality of existing machine learning packages in R for spatiotemporal data analysis, offering a robust framework for constructing and evaluating predictive models across applications like climate science, environmental monitoring, and epidemiology.",
