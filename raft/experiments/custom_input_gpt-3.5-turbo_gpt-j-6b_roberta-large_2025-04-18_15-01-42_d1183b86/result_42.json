    "original": "This study delves into the essential communication boundaries present in a compound channel setting. The discussion revolves around covert communication within the information-theoretic framework, with a key focus on determining the fundamental constraints when the transmitter aims to relay information to authorized receiver(s) while evading detection by an adversary. However, the paper takes a different but equally crucial perspective by addressing scenarios where the primary objective is to conceal the state of the compound channel. Such a communication model proves valuable in scenarios where malicious entities attempt to disrupt signal transmission, particularly in instances where the wireless channel's signal-to-noise ratio is suboptimal. A key highlight of our work is the establishment of bounds on the throughput-key region under the concealment criteria specified in terms of the total variation distance. Furthermore, in cases where the key length is infinite, we present a sufficient condition for when the bounds align concerning the scalability of throughput, adhering to the square-root law. To provide a tangible illustration of our findings, we offer numerical examples, including scenarios involving a Gaussian channel, to exemplify the implications and applications of our results.",
