    "original": "This study introduces a novel framework, Social Chemistry 101, aimed at enhancing comprehension of the cognitive processes that underlie social and moral reasoning. Drawing upon insights from developmental psychology, social psychology, and philosophy, the framework delineates the mechanisms through which individuals acquire moral norms, evaluate diverse considerations in moral decision-making, and navigate conflicts between competing norms. The proposed framework not only offers fresh perspectives on prevalent social and moral challenges, ranging from moral education to political polarization, but also holds the potential to illuminate pressing issues that shape contemporary societies. Backed by empirical studies, theoretical dialogues, and real-world instances, the paper provides practical guidelines for educators and researchers seeking to integrate Social Chemistry 101 into their scholarly pursuits. Ultimately, this framework is envisioned as a tool to bridge disciplinary boundaries, foster interdisciplinary collaboration, and inform strategic interventions that contribute positively to our comprehension of human behavior and societal dynamics.",
