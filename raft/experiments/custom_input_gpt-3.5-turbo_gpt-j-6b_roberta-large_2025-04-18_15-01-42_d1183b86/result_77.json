    "original": "Effectively managing a healthcare crisis requires a profound understanding of public sentiment and perception. Despite previous studies utilizing Twitter data for predictive modeling during the COVID-19 pandemic, in-depth sentiment analysis of people's opinions on social media remains limited. This study addresses this gap by conducting a meticulous sentiment analysis of tweets related to COVID-19. The study involves training four transformer language models in a supervised manner for multi-label classification of tweets into seven tone categories: confident, anger, fear, joy, sadness, analytical, and tentative. Leveraging RoBERTa, the model achieves a high LRAP score of 0.9267, enabling accurate prediction of tweet tones. Subsequently, the model is employed to analyze the tones of 200,000 COVID-19-related tweets, facilitating a country-specific examination of public sentiment and extraction of valuable insights into the psychological state of individuals during the pandemic.",
