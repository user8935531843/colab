    "original": "Recent advancements in the search for unconventional superconductors capable of supporting Majorana fermions, particle-like entities possessing properties suited for dark matter and quantum computing applications, have led to the discovery of topological superconductivity in organic materials. In a breakthrough development, Majorana corner and hinge modes have been experimentally observed in an intrinsic organic topological superconductor at room temperature, eliminating the need for an external magnetic field. Experimental investigations conducted on 1T'-MoS2 flakes, known to undergo a superconductor-insulator transition under electron-beam radiation, unveiled the presence of topological superconductivity on the edges and corners of these flakes through scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy. Spectroscopic data provided further confirmation of Majorana zero-energy modes within the organic material. These findings represent a significant stride towards harnessing organic materials for the realization of Majorana physics and the design of scalable Majorana-based quantum devices, essential for fault-tolerant quantum computing. It is anticipated that these results will inspire novel research endeavors aimed at exploring topological superconductivity in diverse organic materials and propelling the development of cutting-edge quantum technologies.",
