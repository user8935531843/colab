    "original": "This paper introduces a cutting-edge electrochemical model-based adaptive interconnected observer designed for real-time capacity estimation of lithium-ion battery cells. The proposed observer leverages voltage and current data from the battery cell to estimate its electrochemical states and parameters, thereby enabling the calculation of its state-of-charge and capacity. The observer incorporates adaptive mechanisms to ensure resilience against model uncertainties and disturbances, as well as interconnected features for enhanced estimation accuracy and stability. Experimental validation of the observer's performance is conducted on commercial lithium-ion battery cells, demonstrating its ability to accurately and reliably estimate battery capacity, even in the presence of temperature variations, aging effects, and diverse discharge rates. The observer's implementation in battery management systems of electric vehicles and grid storage systems is straightforward, enabling precise monitoring and control of battery performance and health. The study underscores the potential advantages of the proposed observer in optimizing efficiency, safety, and longevity of lithium-ion batteries across a range of practical applications.",
