    "original": "\"The Nova Aquilae 1918 (NA1918), also known as V603 Aquilae, experienced a prominent nova outburst nearly a century ago, captivating the attention of astronomers worldwide. Since its initial observation, researchers have diligently monitored the behavior of NA1918, utilizing astrophysical methodologies based on optical-UV spectra to comprehensively analyze its evolution. Our study highlights a notable long-term decline in the brightness of NA1918, diminishing by 0.44 magnitudes per century between 1938 and 2013. This fading trend, observable in historical records, has persisted over a span of approximately 75 years, displaying a consistent linear decay over time. The gradual reduction in brightness can be attributed to the gradual cooling of the remnant envelope, a natural consequence of the initial energy release during the nova outburst peak, which reached a magnitude of approximately 7.0. Our findings suggest that the observed fading of NA1918 may have been occurring for millennia, shedding light on the underlying physical processes governing novae. Further investigations into similar \"\"fading\"\" phenomena in other nova outbursts will provide valuable insights into the universal nature of these celestial events.\"",
