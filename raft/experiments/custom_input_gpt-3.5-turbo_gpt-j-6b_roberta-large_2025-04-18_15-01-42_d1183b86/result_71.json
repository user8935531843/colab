    "original": "Simulation of magnetization reversal in a small ferromagnetic grain is conducted post-application of an immediate reversal magnetic field. The system's Hamiltonian encompasses exchange interaction, uniaxial anisotropy, Zeeman energy, and dipole-dipole interactions. The grain is discretized into 64 cubic subgrains, with the gyromagnetic equations of motion solved without incorporating damping effects. A novel method is devised to tackle these equations, utilizing solely two variables per sub-cube magnetization and conserving absolute magnitude rigorously. The initial reversal phase comprises uniform rotation succeeded by a nonlinear induction of non-uniform magnetic oscillations driven by the uniform mode. Excess Zeeman energy at the onset is converted into nonlinear spin waves, facilitating significant reversal of average magnetization. The process of magnetization reversal in fine quasi-single-domain grains exhibits characteristic traits of Hamiltonian wave systems with nonlinear diffusion, which becomes restricted under conditions of a potent reversal field and/or a diminutive grain size.",
