    "original": "This study delves into the examination of the Sharp Hardy-Sobolev-Maz'ya, Adams, and Hardy-Adams inequalities on quaternionic hyperbolic spaces and the Cayley hyperbolic plane. Initially, the research establishes the sharp Adams inequality for the quaternionic hyperbolic space, unveiling a novel form of the Poincaré inequality that facilitates the derivation of the Sobolev inequality. Furthermore, the study showcases the optimality of the sharp Hardy-Sobolev-Maz'ya inequality for a specific range of parameters in the quaternionic hyperbolic space. Transitioning to the Cayley hyperbolic plane, the research presents a sharp Hardy-Adams inequality, extending the renowned Hardy and Adams inequalities from Euclidean spaces to the context of the Cayley hyperbolic plane. Additionally, the study reveals a sharp inequality for functions with zero mean value on this space, indicating the presence of a Hardy inequality with a corresponding weight. The investigation into the optimality of these inequalities is complemented by illustrative examples. Finally, the study provides evidence of the sharp Hardy-Adams inequality for the unit ball within the Cayley hyperbolic plane, contributing valuable insights into the geometry and analysis of quaternionic hyperbolic spaces and Cayley hyperbolic planes.",
