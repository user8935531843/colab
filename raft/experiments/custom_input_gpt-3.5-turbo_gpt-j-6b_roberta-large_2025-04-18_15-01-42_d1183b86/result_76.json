    "original": "\"The study investigates the characteristics of the central star and plasma composition of the planetary nebula PC 22, which is enriched with heavy elements. Utilizing a combination of ground-based and space-based observations, high-resolution spectra were obtained across various wavelengths. The analysis focused on determining plasma parameters and deriving electron density and temperature values from emission lines using theoretical approaches. The findings reveal that the central star of PC 22 is a hot subdwarf O star with an effective temperature of approximately 80 kK. Detection of strong neon lines suggests the presence of a He-burning shell within the star. Plasma conditions indicate that the nebula is ionized by the central star, with density distribution exhibiting a nearly uniform profile in the inner region and a sharp decline towards the outer periphery. A comparative analysis with other planetary nebulae reveals that PC 22 belongs to a category of \"\"mature\"\" nebulae that have evolved from a higher-mass progenitor star. These results contribute to a deeper understanding of the formation and evolution of planetary nebulae and the central stars governing their dynamics.\"",
