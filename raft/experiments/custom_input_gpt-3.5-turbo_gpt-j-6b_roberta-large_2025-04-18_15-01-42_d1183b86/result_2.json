    "original": "Acoustic-prosodic entrainment refers to the phenomenon where individuals adjust their speech patterns to align with each other during conversation, influencing conversational dynamics. However, accurately modeling this subtle form of alignment in spoken dialogue presents a significant challenge. In this study, a concise definition for local entrainment in the speech domain is proposed, and an algorithm is developed based on acoustic-prosodic features to measure entrainment. This method aims to maximize differences in features between authentic dialogues involving two individuals and simulated dialogues created by randomly mixing speech turns from the original conversational partners. The approach quantifies turn-by-turn alignment of behavior by projecting interlocutors' differences in acoustic-prosodic features onto a discriminating feature space that optimizes the contrast between authentic and simulated conversations. The effectiveness of this entrainment measurement approach is demonstrated through a classification task to predict conversational outcomes (low versus high success) in task-oriented dialogues, achieving a classification accuracy of 72% using a Naive Bayes classifier. This outperforms existing methods evaluated on the same conversational dataset.",
