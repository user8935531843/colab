    "original": "This research paper introduces a novel approach for addressing the challenge of loop closing in unstructured planetary environments during space exploration missions. Tackling the issue of accurately determining a robot's location upon revisiting previously explored areas, the proposed method focuses on multi-modal loop closing utilizing visually enriched submaps. By leveraging a combination of sensors including monocular cameras, stereo cameras, and LIDAR, the method aims to enhance the accuracy of localization and streamline the loop closing process. Visual enhancements provided by the submaps offer valuable insights into the environment, such as terrain features and lighting conditions, which are typically challenging to capture. Experiment results conducted within the Europlanet-2020 Research Infrastructure demonstrate the efficacy of the method in improving the effectiveness and reliability of loop closing within unstructured environments. This innovative approach has the potential to empower planetary rovers and enhance their exploration capabilities in extraterrestrial landscapes.",
