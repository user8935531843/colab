    "original": "Phishing, a sophisticated cybercrime technique aimed at pilfering personal user information through deceptive websites, poses a significant threat in the digital landscape. In this study, we undertake a systematic approach to identifying phishing URLs by employing a series of methodical steps. Firstly, we meticulously curate lexical features of URLs that exhibit resilience against obfuscation tactics employed by cyber attackers. Subsequently, we assess the efficacy of classification accuracy using solely lexical features, both automatically generated and manually selected, compared to when additional features are incorporated. Our findings indicate that lexical features are adequate for practical applications. Furthermore, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of various classification algorithms and advocate for the utilization of an online method, Adaptive Regularization of Weights (AROW), known for its ability to mitigate noise in training data. Drawing on the insights garnered from our analysis, we propose PhishDef, a phishing detection system that exclusively leverages URL names and integrates the aforementioned components. PhishDef emerges as a highly precise method, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches on real datasets, while maintaining a lightweight architecture suitable for online and client-side implementation. Moreover, PhishDef adopts a proactive approach, relying on online classification rather than static blacklists, and remains robust in the face of inaccuracies in training data, permitting the utilization of extensive and noisy training data.",
