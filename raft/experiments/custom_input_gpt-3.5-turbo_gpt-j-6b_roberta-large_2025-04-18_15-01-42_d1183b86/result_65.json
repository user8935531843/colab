    "original": "An evaluation of the ultraviolet background (UVB) radiation originating from thermal emission caused by gas shock heating during the formation of cosmic structures is conducted using an updated version of the Press-Schechter formalism. This assessment aligns with empirical approximations derived from the observed characteristics of galaxies and the documented cosmic star formation timeline. The primary source of radiation emanates from entities within the mass bracket of 10^{11-13} solar masses, namely significant galaxies and minor groups. Comparative analysis with traditional components (QSOs, stellar) reveals that in proximity to 1 Rydberg, thermal emission matches stellar contributions, constituting around 10%, 20%, and 35% of the overall flux at redshifts of 3, 4.5, and beyond, respectively. Of significance, in the vicinity of the ionization threshold for helium II, thermal emission equates the intensity of QSOs by redshift ~3, gaining dominance at redshifts exceeding 4. Furthermore, thermal photons alone have the capability to initiate and sustain helium II reionization from approximately z~6. The observed Gunn-Peterson effect at elevated redshifts (3<z<6) limits the escape fraction of ionizing photons from galaxies to under a few percent.",
