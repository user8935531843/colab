    "original": "This paper introduces a point-form approach aimed at comprehensively exploring the structural composition of baryons, which are composite particles constituted by three quarks. The structural intricacies of baryons are pivotal for unraveling the intricacies of matter at the subatomic level. Our methodology involves dissecting the distribution of quarks within each baryon as a series of points in a three-dimensional space. Through scrutinizing this point distribution, valuable insights into the properties and dynamics of baryons emerge. Our findings underline the close correlation between the shape and alignment of point distributions and the internal dynamics of baryons, encompassing aspects such as spin and momentum. Moreover, our approach empowers us to forecast the behavior of baryons under varying conditions, be it high-energy settings or when subjected to intense external fields. In essence, our point-form approach serves as a potent tool for delving into the fundamental essence of baryons and their significance in the cosmic fabric.",
