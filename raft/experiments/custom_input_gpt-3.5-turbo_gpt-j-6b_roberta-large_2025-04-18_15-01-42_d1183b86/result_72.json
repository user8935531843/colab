    "original": "This study introduces an innovative computational framework for forecasting visually striking regions within omnidirectional images by leveraging Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL). The framework is underpinned by a discriminative model that autonomously discerns the features of these visually striking regions from expert demonstrations. The architecture entails a hierarchical design for the GAIL model, integrating an image perception module and a saliency prediction module comprising of a generator and a discriminator network. Preliminary findings of the proposed architecture exhibit promise in detecting salient regions within real-world omnidirectional data, outperforming current benchmarks for saliency prediction in standard perspective images while showcasing substantial advancements in feature acquisition. Moreover, the study conducts a comparative analysis of the proposed model against established saliency prediction models, yielding noteworthy improvements in prediction accuracy, rotational invariance, and computational efficiency. The research findings have wide-ranging practical implications, particularly in fields like virtual reality, autonomous vehicle navigation, and multimedia systems. In conclusion, the proposed GAIL framework demonstrates remarkable potential for saliency prediction in omnidirectional images and holds promise for the expansion into other visual perception tasks in the future.",
