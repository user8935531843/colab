    "original": "While it is believed that today's youth may not be as involved in community service as previous generations, there are various factors contributing to this perception. Although some young individuals may be less engaged due to factors such as mobility and global connectivity, it is inaccurate to generalize all young people as disinterested in community involvement. The increased mobility of young individuals, driven by factors like education and employment opportunities, can hinder the development of strong community ties essential for deep engagement. Furthermore, advancements in technology have enabled young people to be part of a global community, fostering connections worldwide and potentially reducing their attachment to a specific local community. Moreover, differing priorities and a focus on personal growth may impact some young individuals' commitment to community service. Despite these factors, numerous young people demonstrate a profound dedication to community service. They actively engage in local and global initiatives, addressing issues like poverty, education, and the environment. Through leveraging technology, they connect with individuals worldwide to tackle global challenges. Some young individuals align their personal passions with community service, working on diverse issues such as food security, animal welfare, and human rights. In essence, while some young people may exhibit lower levels of community engagement, many others exhibit a strong commitment to serving their communities.",
