    "original": "The age-old practice in traditional Chinese culture of withholding the truth about a cancer diagnosis from patients has come under increasing scrutiny in modern society. As debates on this topic persist, it is imperative to acknowledge the validity of arguments on both sides of the issue. The decision to disclose or withhold a cancer diagnosis from a patient must be approached on a case-by-case basis, considering the unique circumstances of each individual. Proponents of full disclosure argue that patients have a fundamental right to be informed about their health status, enabling them to make informed decisions regarding their treatment. Moreover, they assert that withholding such information can lead to heightened stress and anxiety for both the patient and their loved ones. Conversely, advocates for non-disclosure maintain that the emotional burden of knowing the truth may be overwhelming for cancer patients, potentially affecting their quality of life. They also argue that in some cases, not revealing the truth may be in the best interest of the patient's family. This complex moral dilemma underscores the necessity of carefully weighing the nuances of each situation before reaching a decision regarding the disclosure of a cancer diagnosis.",
