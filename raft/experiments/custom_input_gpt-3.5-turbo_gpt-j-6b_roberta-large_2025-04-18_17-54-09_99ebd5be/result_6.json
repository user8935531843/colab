    "original": "While the internet has revolutionized how we access information, books and the written word will continue to remain a fundamental source of knowledge. The longstanding presence of books, coupled with their portability and permanence, ensures their enduring relevance in the digital age. Unlike the internet, books can be easily carried and read anywhere, providing a sense of flexibility and convenience that digital platforms may lack. Additionally, the reliability and privacy offered by books and written material make them a trusted source of information, free from the volatility and potential misinformation found online.

Therefore, while the internet serves as a valuable resource, its limitations prevent it from replacing the enduring significance of books and the written word as primary sources of information.",
