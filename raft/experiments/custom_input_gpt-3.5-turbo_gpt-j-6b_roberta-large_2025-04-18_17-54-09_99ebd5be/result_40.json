    "original": "Modern technology has undeniably revolutionized our lives, offering unprecedented convenience and efficiency. From online food and grocery ordering to remote work capabilities, technological advancements have transformed daily operations. However, there are aspects of simpler times when life was arguably better. At the time, we were less reliant on technology, thereby reducing the likelihood of technical mishaps impacting our daily routines. Additionally, we had more leisure time to connect with others in person and appreciate life without the constant intrusion of technology. Presently, it seems impossible to go a day without utilizing some form of technology, which, while enhancing convenience, also increases dependency. Technological glitches can profoundly disrupt our lives, such as an internet outage hindering work and communication. Moreover, the pervasive nature of technology can lead to distractions, with excessive time spent on social media or watching videos detracting from productivity and leisure activities. Despite these drawbacks, modern technology offers numerous benefits, enabling remote work opportunities, long-distance communication, and streamlined online services for day-to-day chores. Overall, while modern technology has undoubtedly enhanced convenience in many aspects of life, there are valid arguments for the simplicity and balance of earlier times.",
