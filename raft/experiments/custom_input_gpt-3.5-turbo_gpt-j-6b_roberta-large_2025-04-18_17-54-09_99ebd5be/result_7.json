    "original": "In the current era, it is widely acknowledged that it is crucial to inform cancer patients of their condition in order to provide them with the best opportunities for recovery. However, in Chinese culture, it is still common practice to withhold this information from patients. This traditional approach needs to be reconsidered to align with modern advancements. Firstly, being transparent with the patient about their condition allows them to be aware of available treatment options and make informed decisions about their care. This empowers them to optimize their remaining time and receive the best possible treatment. Additionally, being honest with the patient gives them the opportunity to come to terms with their situation and make necessary preparations for the future. Secondly, truthfulness helps maintain trust between the patient and their family. If the patient discovers they have been deceived, it can lead to a breakdown in trust, negatively impacting their mental well-being and causing strain in the patient-family relationship. Finally, transparency enables patients to make the most of their remaining time, create lasting memories with loved ones, and prioritize what matters most to them. In closing, it is imperative to disclose the truth to cancer patients in order to enhance their chances of recovery, uphold trust within the family, and enable patients to cherish their remaining time. Therefore, it is essential to modernize and shift away from the traditional practice of concealing the truth from patients.",
