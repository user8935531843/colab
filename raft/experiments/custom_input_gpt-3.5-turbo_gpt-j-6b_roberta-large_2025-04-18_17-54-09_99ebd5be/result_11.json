    "original": "The debate surrounding whether college graduates should earn higher salaries than the less educated members of the community is a contentious one. Some argue that the extra effort put in by college graduates warrants higher salaries, while others contend that this discrepancy is unjust due to the privileged opportunity of obtaining a college education. I firmly believe that college graduates should earn higher salaries than those less educated for several reasons. Firstly, college graduates have dedicated years to studying and mastering challenging courses, often at a significant financial cost. Their commitment to education justifies higher compensation. Secondly, the disparity in salaries is fair considering that not everyone has had the opportunity to pursue a college education due to financial constraints or familial responsibilities. Lastly, the economic stimulation generated by higher-earning college graduates benefits society at large by creating job opportunities and fostering financial growth. In conclusion, I advocate for higher salaries for college graduates based on their efforts, opportunities, and the positive impact on society as a whole.",
