    "original": "English language proficiency is crucial for Chinese learners, with ongoing debates centered on the significance of reading versus speaking skills. Some argue that reading is paramount, while others prioritize speaking abilities. From my perspective, both reading and speaking are essential for Chinese learners due to various reasons. Reading serves as a foundational skill crucial for language acquisition, enhancing vocabulary, grammar, and comprehension. It exposes learners to diverse writing styles and topics, enriching their linguistic understanding. Additionally, reading allows learners to progress at their own pace, focusing on areas of interest and overcoming pronunciation challenges. Conversely, speaking is vital for fostering communication skills, fluency, and confidence. It enables learners to articulate thoughts, opinions, and emotions effectively, facilitating real-life interactions necessary for socialization and relationship-building. Ultimately, a balanced focus on both reading and speaking is imperative for Chinese learners to excel in English, as each skill contributes uniquely to language proficiency and overall communication abilities.",
