    "original": "Advertisements impact consumer behavior and perceptions, often portraying products in a favorable light, leading some to believe that advertisements inflate product quality. One reason for this belief is that advertisements emphasize the positive aspects of products while downplaying flaws to maximize sales. For instance, when advertising a new phone, only its best features like design and new functions are highlighted, neglecting crucial factors such as battery life. Consequently, consumers may experience disappointment when the product fails to meet their expectations. Another contributing factor is the use of celebrity endorsements in advertisements, influencing consumer perceptions of product quality. Celebrities' endorsement implies product excellence, prompting individuals to emulate their choices despite personal suitability. This tendency, evident in clothing choices inspired by celebrities, may not always yield favorable outcomes. Although advertisements may embellish product attributes, they also disclose essential information to build consumer trust, suggesting a nuanced approach to understanding their impact on consumer attitudes and behavior.",
