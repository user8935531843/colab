    "original": "Indeed, the anticipated decline in the number of cars in usage over the next two decades is inevitable. The emergence of ride-sharing platforms like Uber and Lyft has already diminished the necessity for individual car ownership, a trend which will only be further accelerated by the advent of autonomous vehicles. Autonomous cars are poised to revolutionize the future of transportation through enhanced efficiency, cost-effectiveness, environmental sustainability, and safety features. Their ability to travel closely in packs, communicate with each other to avoid accidents, and operate without the need for a driver significantly optimizes road space utilization. Furthermore, the lower operational costs of autonomous cars, coupled with their ability to operate remotely and reduce the need for parking infrastructure, will alleviate congestion and repurpose urban real estate. Embracing environmentally-friendly practices, autonomous vehicles produce zero emissions and are compatible with renewable energy sources, thereby reducing pollution levels and enhancing air quality in urban areas. The superior safety features of autonomous cars, including the elimination of distractions and impaired driving, are poised to drastically reduce accidents and fatalities on roads. Overall, the multifaceted advantages of autonomous vehicles signal a paradigm shift in transportation, with a foreseeable decrease in the prevalence of traditional vehicles and a heightened reliance on autonomous alternatives in the coming decades.",
