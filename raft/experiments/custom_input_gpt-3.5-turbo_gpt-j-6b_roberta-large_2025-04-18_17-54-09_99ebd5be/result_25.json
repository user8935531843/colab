    "original": "Universities, as institutions of higher education, have long been a subject of debate regarding their purpose. While some argue that university education primarily serves to prepare individuals for employment, others contend that it serves broader functions. In my view, university education offers multifaceted benefits beyond just job readiness. Firstly, universities foster critical thinking skills among students by teaching them to assess and analyze information thoughtfully. This skill is invaluable across various spheres of life, extending beyond the realm of employment. For instance, individuals with a university education can critically evaluate media content, political discourse, and social issues. Secondly, university education nurtures social skills by exposing students to diverse backgrounds and cultures, thereby fostering communication, teamwork, and leadership abilities. These skills are paramount in all facets of life, not solely within a professional setting. Thirdly, university education instills a sense of civic responsibility in students through courses that address social issues within their communities. This exposure motivates students to engage actively in community affairs and uphold civic values. Lastly, university education cultivates a passion for learning by offering a wide array of subjects for students to explore based on their interests. Such exposure kindles a lifelong love for learning that transcends formal education and enriches both personal and professional growth. In essence, the functions of university education extend far beyond employment preparation, encompassing the development of critical thinking, social skills, civic responsibility, and a profound appreciation for learning. Universities play a pivotal role in shaping individuals who contribute positively to society, emphasizing the significance of providing education that transcends mere job readiness.",
