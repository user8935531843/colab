    "original": "There is a consensus that the utilization of cars will dwindle in the upcoming two decades. This trend can be attributed to the surge in popularity of ride-sharing services like Uber and Lyft, escalating costs associated with car ownership and maintenance, and the increasing recognition of the hazardous impacts of car-related pollution. The popularity of ride-sharing services has revolutionized transportation by allowing individuals to conveniently request rides via mobile devices, thereby reducing the necessity of car ownership for daily commuting. Furthermore, the rising expenses linked to purchasing and upkeeping a vehicle, coupled with escalating gasoline prices, have prompted individuals to reassess the necessity of car ownership. Additionally, the heightened awareness of the negative environmental and health repercussions of car-related emissions is prompting a shift towards alternative modes of transportation, such as public transport or ride-sharing services. The convergence of these factors underscores the trajectory towards a reduced number of cars in use in the foreseeable future.",
