    "original": "XMM-Newton was utilized to analyze the X-ray properties of the eclipsing magnetic cataclysmic variable 2PBC J0658.0-1746, confirming its classification as a polar system through optical observations. The X-ray emissions displayed distinct brightness patterns, including total eclipses occurring every 2.38 hours, aligning with optical behavior. This discovery establishes 2PBC J0658.0-1746 as the second hard X-ray-selected eclipsing polar within the orbital period gap. The X-ray flux exhibited significant variability over varying timescales, indicating fluctuations in the mass accretion rate. By refining the orbital ephemeris through X-ray eclipses, the binary inclination was constrained between 79 and 90 degrees, with a mass ratio range of 0.18 to 0.40. Notably, the companion mass was estimated at 0.2 to 0.25 solar masses, with a radius of 0.24 to 0.26 solar radii and a spectral type of M4. Additionally, the white dwarf mass was inferred to be at least 0.6 solar masses based on the X-ray spectrum. Constraints on the magnetic colatitude and offset in azimuth suggest a non-stationary mass accretion process with a focus on the main accreting pole. Spectral energy distribution analysis revealed significant excess in the mid-IR due to cyclotron emission. Through detailed multi-wavelength observations and meticulous analysis, 2PBC J0658.0-1746 emerges as a compelling and informative case study within the rare category of hard X-ray eclipsing polars, shedding light on the behaviors and characteristics of magnetic cataclysmic variables within the orbital period gap.",
