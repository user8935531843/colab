    "original": "We propose a new method for determining the local value of the Hubble constant by calibrating the Tip of the Red Giant Branch (TRGB) on Type Ia supernovae. Our analysis yields a value of Ho = 69.8 +/- 0.8 km/sec/Mpc. The TRGB method is highly precise and accurate, independently verifying the Cepheid distance scale. Our calculated value aligns with current Hubble tension levels and shows agreement with the Planck 2018 estimate and the SHoES measurement based on Cepheid distances. We measure TRGB distances using deep Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) imaging of galaxy halos and anchor these distances using the Carnegie Supernova Project I sample. Comparatively, TRGB distances offer advantages over Cepheid variables, including reduced halo reddening, minimal photometry interference, and less sensitivity to metallicity. By leveraging TRGB distances, we expand our understanding of the Universe's fundamental properties, contributing to the ongoing efforts to enhance cosmological knowledge. We present a study on the spectral properties of the linear operator $\\mathcal{L}\\_{\\Omega}+a$ in $C(\\bar\\Omega)$, focusing on the generalised principal eigenvalue $\\lambda\\_p(\\mathcal{L}\\_{\\Omega}+a)$. We establish the equivalence of different definitions of the principal eigenvalue and analyze its behavior with respect to scaling $K$. Specifically, for kernels characterized by $K(x,y)=J(x-y)$, we investigate asymptotic properties of $\\lambda\\_{p} \\left(\\mathcal{L}\\_{\\sigma,m,\\Omega} -\\frac{1}{\\sigma^m}+a\\right)$. Our analysis demonstrates that the principal eigenvalue is a crucial property to understand the operator's behavior and how it scales with varying parameters. We also provide insights into the convergence properties of the corresponding eigenfunction, shedding light on the broader understanding of spectral properties of nonlocal operators.",
