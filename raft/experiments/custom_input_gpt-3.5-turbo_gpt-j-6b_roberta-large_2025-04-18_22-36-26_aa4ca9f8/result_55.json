    "original": "Recent advancements in signal processing have revolutionized the accuracy of recovering linear signals from b-bit-quantized linear measurements. The intricate relationship between the bit depth and the requisite number of measurements for precise signal recovery remains a subject of scholarly inquiry. A comprehensive analysis is presented in this paper, exploring the impact of bit depth and measurement quantity on signal recovery quality. Leveraging the principles of compressed sensing, a framework capitalizing on signal sparsity in specific basis domains, we introduce a groundbreaking recovery algorithm that capitalizes on the structure of linear signals for accurate recovery from quantized linear measurements. Additionally, a novel metric is proposed to assess recovered signal quality, accounting for the signal-to-(quantization) noise ratio and signal sparsity level. Through a blend of theoretical analysis and extensive experiments, we elucidate how the choice of bit depth and measurement quantity fundamentally influences signal recovery accuracy. It is demonstrated that increasing the bit depth markedly enhances the quality of recovered signals for a fixed measurement budget. Conversely, escalating the number of measurements for a fixed bit depth yields diminishing returns in signal quality. This analysis holds significant implications for compressed sensing applications, particularly in scenarios constrained by limited storage, transmission, or computational resources. By delving into the trade-off between bit depth and measurement quantity, optimized strategies for signal acquisition and recovery can be formulated across an array of applications ranging from image and audio processing to communications and control systems.",
