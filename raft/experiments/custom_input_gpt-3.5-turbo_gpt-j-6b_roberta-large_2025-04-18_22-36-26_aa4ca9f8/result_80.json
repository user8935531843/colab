    "original": "This study investigates the conical refraction of hydromagnetic waves in plasma with anisotropic thermal pressure, exploring the propagation characteristics of such waves in a magnetoplasma featuring a non-Maxwellian particle distribution. The results reveal that the direction and shape of the waves are significantly influenced by the anisotropic thermal pressure, with potential implications for plasma physics and astrophysical phenomena. Model-based design offers a systematic approach to developing reliable and secure cyber-physical systems (CPSs) by constructing mathematically precise models of the system and conducting thorough correctness analyses before generating the implementation from the model. However, evolving requirements due to new vulnerabilities necessitate an effective and economical automated mechanism to repair the initial design, as repeated redesign and reimplementation can be time-consuming. In this paper, a novel methodology and Matlab toolkit called REAFFIRM are proposed to facilitate model-based repair for enhancing CPSs' resiliency. REAFFIRM takes as input an original hybrid system, a specified resiliency pattern, and a safety requirement, and outputs a repaired model satisfying the requirement. The framework consists of a model transformation module and a model synthesizer built on the Breach falsification tool, utilizing the HATL language for specifying resiliency patterns in hybrid systems. Using REAFFIRM, automatic synthesis of repaired models was successfully demonstrated for adaptive cruise control, single-machine infinite-bus, and missile guidance systems subjected to various attacks. Hybrid systems, with both continuous and discrete components, benefit from REAFFIRM's quantitative resilience models to detect and mitigate faults systematically, showcasing its potential for improving the resiliency of safety-critical systems.",
