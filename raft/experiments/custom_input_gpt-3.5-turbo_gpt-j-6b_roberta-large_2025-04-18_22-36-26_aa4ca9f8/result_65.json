    "original": "The study of scalar curvature flow involves exploring changes in the scalar curvature of a space over time, with a particular focus on regions with zero scalar curvature that remain flat throughout the flow. Results indicate that solutions to the flow tend to converge exponentially towards a Ricci-flat metric in areas where the scalar curvature is initially non-zero. Furthermore, the boundedness of scalar curvature during the flow is established, along with an explicit formula for the maximum scalar curvature attained throughout the evolution. This research aims to provide insights into the complex interplay between geometry and evolution by examining the global behavior of the flow in these contexts. Additionally, an innovative adaptive refinement framework employing the Radial Basis Functions-generated Finite Differences method is proposed. This approach involves the generation of node distributions from a continuous density function using a Poisson Disk Sampling-based algorithm, which is adjusted during the refinement process based on error indicators. By relying solely on meshless concepts, the proposed adaptive strategy offers flexibility and generality in solution procedures. Demonstrated through the analysis of various contact problems, including disk pressure and Hertzian contact scenarios, the proposed methodology exhibits exceptional accuracy and efficiency comparable to FEM, without the need for manual refinement. Furthermore, its application to complex industrial contact problems showcases the adaptability, accuracy, and computational efficiency of the Adaptive Radial Basis Function-generated Finite Differences (ARBF-FD) method, underscoring its potential for advancing engineering simulations.",
