    "original": "The research delves into the observation of ventilated supercavitation behaviors with varying cavitator shapes and mounting struts to enhance supercavitating vehicle design practices. The study fabricates cavitators of different shapes, including triangles, disks, and cones, and mounts them on forward-facing models (FFM). Ventilation requirements for generating (C_Qf) and sustaining (C_Qc) a supercavity are evaluated across a broad range of Froude numbers (Fr) for each cavitator and compared to backward-facing models (BFM). Results indicate that the cone-shaped cavitator requires the least air to generate a supercavity across most flow regimes, except at very high Fr. The disk FFM exhibits a lower C_Qc than its BFM counterpart at lower Fr, surpassing BFM C_Qc at higher Fr. For all cavitators, the cone cavitator demonstrates the smallest C_Qc across all Fr ranges in the study. The study additionally conducts simultaneous measurements of internal pressure and cavity dimensions to illuminate cavity sustenance behaviors. Through high-speed imaging combined with cavity pressure measurements and cavity dimension data, the study estimates re-entrant jet momentum for disk and cone cavitators. Findings reveal that re-entrant jet momentum aligns with ventilation air momentum under C_Qc at lower Fr for both cavitator cases, particularly showcasing stronger re-entrant jet presence for the disk cavitator. Results from the ventilated supercavitation experiments provide insights for enhancing cavitator design strategies and ventilation approaches for real-world supercavitating vehicle applications.",
