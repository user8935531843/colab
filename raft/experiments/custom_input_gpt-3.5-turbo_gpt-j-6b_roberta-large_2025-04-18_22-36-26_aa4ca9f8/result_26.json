    "original": "This study delves into the development of a two-dimensional cross-diffusion model to analyze the propagation of urban crime, leveraging nonlinear diffusion for enhanced insights. Through mathematical modeling and numerical simulations, the research explores the dynamics of crime spread in urban areas over time, considering factors like population density, crime rate, and diffusion processes. The incorporation of nonlinear diffusion aids in depicting crime distribution in urban regions, with cross-diffusion accounting for interactions between different criminal activities. By controlling diffusion rates and interaction strengths, the model demonstrates efficient crime rate reduction and relaxation in urban areas. Moreover, the study identifies key determinants influencing the speed and extent of crime propagation, yielding valuable insights for policymakers and law enforcement agencies. Additionally, this paper introduces an innovative approach to studying urban crime propagation, offering a novel perspective on addressing and understanding crime dynamics within urban environments.",
