    "original": "The emergence of the social network platform Gab, a proponent of free speech, arose from concerns about content moderation on mainstream social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook. However, Gab was removed from the Google Play Store and rejected by Apple due to violations of hate speech policies. This study delves into the characterization of Gab, exploring the user demographics and content shared on the platform. Findings reveal a strong political orientation on Gab, with banned users from other platforms and a prevalence of far-right ideologies and conspiracy theories. Content dissemination on Gab perpetuates a right-leaning echo chamber, reinforcing existing political and social viewpoints with minimal exposure to diverse perspectives. The study highlights the inflammatory rhetoric and polarization within Gab's discourse, emphasizing the normalization of extremist attitudes and the erosion of civil discourse. The research underscores the importance of ongoing inquiry into unmoderated social systems and their impact on public discourse and societal attitudes. The study on de-anonymization risks in social networks addresses concerns about privacy protection in the digital age, focusing on the threat of linking anonymous data to individual identities. Introducing a quantitative framework to assess de-anonymization risks, the study analyzes vulnerabilities in various publicly available social networks, identifying persistent de-anonymization attack patterns and potential breaches of sensitive user information. The research emphasizes the need for continued exploration of mitigation strategies and further investigation into privacy safeguards in social networking platforms. The investigation into the destruction of interstellar dust via sputtering in supernova shocks employs three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations to quantify dust loss and explore dust dynamics within a turbulent interstellar medium. The study reveals dominant nonthermal sputtering processes and varying dust destruction timescales dependent on supernova environments. Additionally, the research uncovers spatial variations in the dust-to-gas mass ratio and its correlation with gas density and temperature, showcasing complex dynamics within the multiphase interstellar medium. The findings shed light on the role of dust in galactic evolution and highlight the importance of detailed modeling of dust physics in understanding astrophysical environments. In the investigation of particle acceleration in weakly-magnetized, mildly relativistic shocks, particle-in-cell simulations uncover the mechanisms driving non-thermal ion instabilities and revealing the complex structures formed in the shock fronts. The study distinguishes between subluminal and superluminal shocks, showcasing the energy fraction distribution in non-thermal protons and electrons, and the significance of magnetic turbulence in properly measuring non-thermal electron energy efficiency. The research provides insights into the acceleration processes in astrophysical objects hosting quasi-parallel shocks, offering implications for cosmic ray production and its associated emissions, such as gamma-rays and neutrinos.",
