    "original": "Generalized zero-shot learning (GZSL) is a challenging aspect of computer vision, requiring the adaptation of models to recognize unseen classes. The suggested novel graph-based approach for learning priors in GZSL involves leveraging a graph to establish semantic connections between observed and unseen classes. This approach includes a regularization component to encourage model compliance with these relationships, resulting in top-tier performance and insightful visual representations of the acquired priors. An exploration of the components' significance and ablation studies underscore the effectiveness of this approach, emphasizing the relevance of graph-based priors in enhancing generalized zero-shot learning models. In a related realm, recent advancements in deep learning technologies have propelled the integration of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for automated carcinoma detection in confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE) images. CLE, a high-magnification microscopic technique ideal for structural tissue assessment, has been evaluated with a deep learning-based algorithm designed for identifying oral squamous cell carcinoma. Notably, the algorithm, initially trained on oral cavity data, demonstrated notable performance when extrapolated to vocal cord data, showcasing its robust generalizability and potential to transcend anatomical constraints across head and neck areas. Moreover, a patch-based machine learning approach exhibited swift and objective identification of cancerous regions in CLE images through CNN-driven classification, proving superior accuracy compared to traditional manual detection methods. The method's cross-site robustness, tested on multiple imaging sites, affirmed its efficacy and generalizability in carcinoma detection within diverse imaging setups. These advancements underscore the efficacy and potential applications of innovative techniques in enhancing diagnostic accuracy and treatment outcomes in cancer detection. Finally, the integration of higher order hesitant fuzzy (HOHF) Choquet integral operator in decision-making addresses the limitations of traditional fuzzy integrals by considering interdependent criteria interactions. By extending the hesitant fuzzy set theory, the proposed HOHF Choquet integral operator captures higher-order interactions among criteria, enhancing decision-making accuracy and efficiency. This operator's application in socio-economic policy assessment and comparison with existing techniques, like TODIM, validates its superiority in handling uncertainty and hesitancy, offering valuable insights into complex decision-making processes. Through these innovative methods and frameworks, researchers aim to enhance decision-making processes in multi-criteria scenarios, ultimately fostering informed decisions and sustainable outcomes.",
