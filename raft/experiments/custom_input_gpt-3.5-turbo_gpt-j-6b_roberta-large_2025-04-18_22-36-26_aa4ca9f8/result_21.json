    "original": "$\\beta$-decay spectroscopy serves as a vital tool for exploring exotic nuclei and testing nuclear theories beyond stability boundaries. To investigate the properties of $^{25}$Al excited states, a quest for new $\\beta$-delayed protons and $\\gamma$ rays of $^{25}$Si was embarked upon. Employing the Gaseous Detector with Germanium Tagging system at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory, $^{25}$Si $\\beta$ decays were meticulously investigated, with concurrent detection of emitted protons and $\\gamma$ rays. Leveraging a Monte Carlo method, Doppler broadening of $^{24}$Mg $\\gamma$-ray lines due to nuclear recoil from proton emission was modeled. Shell-model calculations, adopting newly developed universal \\textit{sd}-shell Hamiltonians (USDC and USDI), were meticulously performed. This study resulted in the most accurate determination of the $^{25}$Si half-life to date, uncovering a novel proton branch at 724(4)~keV and identifying fresh proton-$\\gamma$-ray coincidences. Notably, three $^{24}$Mg $\\gamma$-ray lines and eight $^{25}$Al $\\gamma$-ray lines were newly observed in $^{25}$Si decay. Furthermore, the inaugural measurement of the $^{25}$Si $\\beta$-delayed $\\gamma$ ray intensities through the $^{25}$Al unbound states was reported. Overall, the enhanced decay scheme constructed sheds light on the complexities of exotic isotopes like $^{25}$Al, offering intriguing insights into the fine nuances of nuclear structure and decay. This paper presents an advanced study of barlowite, Cu$_{4}$(OH)$_{6}$FBr, a compelling material as the parent compound of a prospective series of quantum spin liquid candidates, Zn$_{x}$Cu$_{4-x}$(OH)$_{6}$FBr. Despite exhibiting a magnetic phase transition to a long-range ordered phase at $T_{N} = 15$ K, the nuclear and magnetic structures of barlowite have remained elusive. Through thorough powder neutron diffraction analyses on deuterated barlowite samples, the orthorhombic $Pnma$ space group emerged as the sole consistent space group accommodating both nuclear and magnetic diffraction at low temperatures. Employing a Monte Carlo-based methodology, the magnetic intensity at $T < T_{N}$ was found to adhere accurately to the $Pn^\\prime m^\\prime a$ magnetic space group, endorsing the ferromagnetic component evident in prior single-crystal and powder magnetisation studies. This magnetic configuration aligns closely with clinoatacamite, Cu$_{4}$(OH)$_{6}$Cl$_{2}$, the prototype of the renowned quantum spin liquid candidate hebertsmithite, ZnCu$_{3}$(OH)$_{6}$Cl$_{2}$. The investigation showcasing the nuclear and magnetic intricacies of barlowite offers profound insights into the enigmatic domain of frustrated quantum antiferromagnets, laying a solid foundation for deeper comprehension of these fascinating materials. Holomorphic matrix models, revered for their role in scrutinizing quantum field theories, are noted for their distinctive analytical characteristic of matrix variables obeying holomorphic properties. Widely explored within theoretical physics, holomorphic matrix models have proven invaluable for analyzing two-dimensional string theories, addressing non-perturbative effects hitherto challenging to tackle. Their utility extends across studies on matrix quantum mechanics, random matrix theory, and integrable systems. Despite their versatility, a myriad of questions surround holomorphic matrix models, notably the intricate linkages with topological string theory. This review offers an introspective analysis of the current landscape of research on holomorphic matrix models, including recent breakthroughs and future trajectories, shedding light on pivotal unanswered queries and unexplored territories within this field of study.",
