    "original": "The emergence of advanced machine translation (MT) technologies has raised claims of achieving human-like translation accuracy, with some researchers asserting results comparable to those of bilingual human translators. While these claims are often sensationalized and lack a comprehensive analysis, our research focuses on discerning the distinctions between statistical and neural approaches to MT and human translation processes. By scrutinizing MT output through the lens of linguistic theory, we have identified remaining translation challenges, ranging from simple grammar errors to complex aspects such as tense and aspectual values. While neural MT has surpassed statistical MT in various aspects, lingering challenges persist. Our work addresses key research questions concerning the intricate relationship between linguistics and MT, pinpointing areas where linguistic information is lacking for accurate translations. We identified an \"algorithmic bias\" or overgeneralization as a potential issue with neural MT, contributing to persisting linguistic challenges. Integration of linguistic features into statistical and neural MT systems is a focus of our research, aiming to enhance translation accuracy and address ongoing challenges within natural language processing (NLP). By integrating linguistic features into MT models, additional context and nuances in language can be captured, improving translation quality and offering new opportunities for advancements in machine translation research. Our study provides a comprehensive survey of approaches to integrating linguistic features into MT, showcasing the impact on translation quality and presenting avenues for further research in this domain. Our work aims to unlock the full potential of linguistic features in machine translation systems, ultimately enhancing translation accuracy and efficiency.",
