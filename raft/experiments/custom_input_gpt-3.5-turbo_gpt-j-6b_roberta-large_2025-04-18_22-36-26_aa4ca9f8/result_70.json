    "original": "The application of X-ray analytical techniques in investigating nanoparticle structures and properties, including X-ray diffraction, fluorescence, absorption spectroscopy, and small-angle scattering, is essential for understanding their behavior in various applications. The interaction between nanoparticle properties, such as size, shape, crystallinity, defects, and surface charges, and X-ray analytical techniques plays a critical role in enhancing nanoparticle performance. By analyzing the fluorescence of nanodiamonds in histological sections of mouse organs and tumors, researchers have developed a method for quantifying the bioavailability of fluorescent nanodiamonds after systemic injection. Using a specialized time-delayed fluorescence microscope with subcellular resolution and single-particle sensitivity, researchers were able to visualize and quantify the distribution and aggregation state of cationic nanodiamonds designed to transport therapeutic small interfering RNA for treating Ewing sarcoma. The method demonstrated the low nanoparticle yield in the tumor after intravenous injection, prompting researchers to administer the nanomedicine directly into the tumor, resulting in a significant inhibition of the oncogene responsible for Ewing sarcoma. This approach showcases the potential of utilizing fluorescence microscopy for evaluating the efficacy and biodistribution of nanomedicines, paving the way for advancements in nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems.
