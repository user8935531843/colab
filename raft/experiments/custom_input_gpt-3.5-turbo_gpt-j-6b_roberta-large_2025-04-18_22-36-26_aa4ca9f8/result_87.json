    "original": "This study presents a novel video coding framework tailored for intelligent collaborative analytics, focusing on compressing visual representations of large datasets while maintaining or improving analytical model accuracy. The hierarchical compression strategy optimizes spatio-temporal and semantic representations of input video data by leveraging deep learning-based video analysis and generative modeling. The framework achieves high compression ratios with minimal fidelity loss, validated through case studies on action recognition and event detection tasks. The results demonstrate superior performance in visual quality and analytical accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods, reducing video data size by up to 90% without compromising performance. The study also explores the framework's adaptability to different visual data types, suggesting applications in autonomous driving, video surveillance, and multimedia content delivery. This research introduces an innovative discourse analysis approach for Persian Twitter social networks using graph mining and natural language processing techniques. Analyzing COVID-19 communication on the platform reveals a strong link between political and religious discourses and misinformation, driven by regional political and socio-economic factors. The findings offer insight for governments, organizations, and public health officials to combat misinformation and develop effective communication strategies. The study contributes to understanding the impact of social media on COVID-19 discourse, highlighting the need for data-driven approaches to address misinformation. Additionally, the research explores magnetic field dynamics in molecular clouds, focusing on G34.43+0.24 through polarization-sensitive submillimeter camera observations. The study reveals complex magnetic field structures with varying strengths across different regions, influencing the formation and evolution of dense filaments and cores within the cloud. Simulation results suggest the magnetic field plays a significant role in shaping the cloud structure and promoting the contraction of denser regions. This work contributes to the understanding of magnetic fields in star formation processes, emphasizing their importance in molecular cloud dynamics. Another study introduces a novel method for reconstructing heat-reflection indices at solid interfaces in phonon transport equations. By combining analytical and numerical techniques, the approach addresses the challenge of accurately determining these indices, with potential applications in thermal barrier coatings and advanced materials design.",
