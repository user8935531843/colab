    "original": "Keplerian integrals are essential tools within celestial mechanics, particularly for analyzing short arcs in extensive databases of optical observations. By pioneering a novel method that leverages elimination theory, we propose an efficient approach to identifying very short arcs, enhancing the speed and accuracy of optical observation analysis. With a primary focus on amorphous MoGe films, we conduct linear and nonlinear transport measurements across a broad range of temperatures and magnetic fields to delve into the fragile-glass dynamics of 2D weakly pinned vortex systems. Unveiling the VFT resistivity form at low fields and a standard vortex liquid behavior at elevated fields, our study underscores the heterogeneous dynamics instigated by orientational correlations. We also uncover a shift towards a strong-glass behavior under high magnetic fields, shedding light on the intricate interplay between disorder and orientational correlations during the melting process in 2D systems. Our findings offer a fresh perspective on the dynamics of phase transitions in 2D systems featuring competing orders, enriching our understanding of condensed matter systems. By harnessing the power of sensors, both charged particles and photons can be accurately detected across all three frontiers in Particle Physics. Sensors capture a myriad of signals like ionization deposition, phonon creation, and light emission to detect individual or grouped particles. Crucial for advancements in new experiments, sensor performance metrics such as position resolution, time resolution, rate capabilities, usable detector area, and cost are pivotal. Additionally, with a rising demand for radiation tolerance in various devices, ongoing efforts are aimed at enhancing sensor capabilities to meet evolving requirements. This extensive review encapsulates a broad range of sensor types, presenting current challenges and ongoing efforts to address them, underscoring the critical role of sensors in modern scientific endeavors.",
