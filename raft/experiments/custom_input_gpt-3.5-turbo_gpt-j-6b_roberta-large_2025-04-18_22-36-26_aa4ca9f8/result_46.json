    "original": "High-resolution spectroscopic observations of a decaying sunspot were conducted using the Solar Optical Telescope on board the Hinode satellite. The study focused on NOAA 10944, situated on the solar surface from March 2 to March 4, 2007. The observations revealed the presence of umbral dots (UDs) within the umbra region, characterized by their size and magnetic structures. Magnitudes of magnetic field strength, inclination angle, and Doppler velocity around UDs exhibited center-to-limb variations. UDs located at disk center displayed slightly weaker magnetic fields and relative blue shifts compared to their surroundings. However, minimal differences were observed in the magnetic and Doppler values of UDs and their surroundings as the sunspot approached the limb. This center-to-limb variation is attributed to a cusp-shaped magnetized atmosphere surrounding UDs, resulting from weakly magnetized hot gas intrusions. Some UDs exhibited oscillatory light curves with multiple peaks around 10 minutes, indicating potential oscillatory convection. The results are discussed within the frameworks of theoretical models such as the monolithic model and the field-free intrusion model. Through advanced observations and analyses, the magnetic nature of UDs rooted in unipolar regions with a weak magnetic field is elucidated, shedding light on their potential role in energy transport and magnetism within sunspots. The implications underscore the importance of understanding the dynamics and magnetic properties of small dark features like UDs to advance knowledge on the Sun's magnetic structures and energy transport processes. Zero-shot learning (ZSL) involves predicting labels of samples from unseen classes by utilizing side information about class labels, such as label attributes or word embeddings. The task has evolved into generalized ZSL (GZSL), where test sets comprise both seen and unseen samples. Recent advancements in GZSL rely on leveraging generative models to generate samples from unseen classes. This study integrates an additional source of side information in the form of a relation graph over labels. By incorporating this graph, a set of prior distributions is learned to guide an aligned variational autoencoder (VAE) model towards embedding learning that respects the graph structure. Through this innovative approach, enhanced performance is achieved on benchmark datasets such as CUB and SUN over a strong baseline, showcasing the potential of leveraging graph-based side information for improved ZSL outcomes.",
