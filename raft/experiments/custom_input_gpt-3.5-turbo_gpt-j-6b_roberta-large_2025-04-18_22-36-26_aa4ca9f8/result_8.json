    "original": "Investigating Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) through near-infrared observations within a restricted redshift range is crucial for minimizing uncertainties and maximizing cosmological accuracy. The SNe Ia in the study exhibit standardized light-curve properties, making them ideal standard candles. By fitting NIR light-curve templates to high-precision data, peak magnitudes can be derived with minimal scatter. Utilizing a standard cosmology, absolute magnitudes are calculated for the J and H bands, highlighting the exceptional precision of NIR measurements. Notably, a significant correlation is found between the J-band residual and the J-H pseudo-colour. Enabled by NIR observations, precise distance measurements with reduced scatter are achievable, offering new insights into the expansion history of the universe and peculiar velocities of nearby galaxies. The application of NIR observations has revolutionized the field of precision cosmology by providing enhanced accuracy in determining cosmological parameters, ultimately advancing our understanding of the universe. In a similar vein, the LHCb collaboration's proposed Upgrade II aims to extend the capabilities of the Upgrade I detector by leveraging the strengths of the current LHCb experiment. This upgrade will enable high-precision measurements of CP-violating phases and probe transitions unattainable in previous experiments, thereby unlocking new physics insights. By enhancing the precision and sensitivity of experiments, Upgrade II will significantly contribute to the study of flavour physics and explore rare phenomena beyond the Standard Model. Moreover, the proposed detector upgrade will facilitate studies in areas like hadron spectroscopy and Higgs-charm quark interactions, promising breakthroughs in understanding low-energy QCD and exotic particle behaviors. Through the implementation of innovative harmonic mortar methods, electric machine simulations can efficiently handle stator-rotor coupling utilizing trigonometric polynomials as Lagrange multipliers. This approach allows for precise torque computation through energetic considerations, with numerical tests demonstrating its superior performance and scalability in evaluating torque ripples. The use of harmonic mortar methods offers a novel technique for torque computation in electric machine simulations, providing accurate results for diverse geometric configurations and showcasing significant improvements over existing methods.",
