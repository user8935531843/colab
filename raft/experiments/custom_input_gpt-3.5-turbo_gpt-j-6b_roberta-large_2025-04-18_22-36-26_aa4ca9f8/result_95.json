    "original": "Recent studies on the collapse of rotating molecular cloud cores with axial symmetry provide insights into the evolution of young stellar objects. Through simulations and calculations, crucial aspects such as the timescale for disk formation, angular momentum redistribution, and the origin of calcium-aluminium-rich inclusions (CAIs) have been examined. The formation of protostellar disks and the role of rotation in the collapse process are pivotal in understanding star and planet formation. Insights gained from these studies shed light on the complex interplay between gravity, rotation, and magnetic fields during protostellar collapse, offering valuable insights into the formation of stars and planets. Furthermore, investigations into the HI disk flaring in the outer regions of galaxies have challenged conventional assumptions about dark matter halo shapes, suggesting a need for reconsideration of the halo density profile. Finite-sized spherical halos with density falling faster than isothermal profiles are found to better align with observations, exemplifying the intricate nature of galactic structure and the need for continuous exploration and refinement of existing models. Additionally, unconventional Bose-Einstein condensations that break the time-reversal symmetry, resulting in complex-valued many-body wavefunctions, open up new avenues for studying quantum phenomena and developing novel quantum technologies. These diverse research findings underscore the multifaceted nature of astrophysics and quantum physics and emphasize the importance of ongoing research and exploration in these dynamic fields.",
