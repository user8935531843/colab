    "original": "The Chandra X-ray observation of the massive star formation region G5.89-0.39 and its association with the TeV gamma-ray source HESSJ1800-240B are investigated in this study. The region consists of two distinct HII regions, G5.89-0.39A and G5.89-0.39B. A total of 159 individual X-ray point sources were identified, with 35 sources linked to the HII complex G5.89-0.39. These sources exhibit an average unabsorbed luminosity typical of B7-B5 type stars. The potential ionizing source of G5.89-0.39B, known as Feldt's star, displays an unabsorbed X-ray luminosity indicative of a B7-B5 star. The stacked energy spectra of these sources are well-fitted with a single thermal plasma APEC model, suggesting a stellar content consistent with earlier estimations in both G5.89-0.39A and B. Variability analysis reveals that ten of the X-ray sources in G5.89-0.39 exhibit variability, potentially indicating pre-main sequence stars influencing the GeV to TeV gamma-ray emission in HESSJ1800-240B. Further research is needed to elucidate the precise causes of this variability and its implications in the region.",
