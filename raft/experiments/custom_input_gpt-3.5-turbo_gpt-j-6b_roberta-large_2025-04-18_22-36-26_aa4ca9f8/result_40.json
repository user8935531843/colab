    "original": "The Oscillatory Fourier Neural Network (OFNN) is an innovative architecture for sequential data processing that expands upon the capabilities of the Fourier neural network (FNN) by integrating intrinsic oscillations. Resulting in enhanced performance compared to standard FNNs, the OFNN excels in capturing temporal dynamics through compact and sparse representations. Suited for applications such as signal processing, image recognition, speech recognition, and control systems, the OFNN leverages the Fourier transform to convert signals into sine and cosine functions. However, the OFNN extends this transformation to include oscillatory functions, enabling the network to adapt to nonstationary and time-varying signals. A novel training method inspired by the Oscillatory, Divergent, and Weight Perturbation (ODWP) algorithms introduces oscillating weights to the network connections, inducing oscillatory behavior that allows the network to comprehend the temporal dynamics of input data. Experimental evaluations showcase the superior performance of the OFNN over existing sequential and recurrent neural networks on various benchmark tasks. With higher accuracy, significantly lower computational costs, and comparable or improved performance on challenging datasets, the OFNN presents a promising approach for real-world applications. Density functional theory has been utilized to investigate the potential for superconductivity in AC6 compounds, where A is Mg, Ca, Sr, or Ba. The study predicts superconductivity in Ba and Sr at zero pressure, with critical temperatures (Tc) of 0.2 K and 3.0 K, respectively. Assessing the pressure dependence of Tc while assuming consistent crystal structures at zero and finite pressures reveals a substantial enhancement in the critical temperatures of SrC6 and BaC6 under pressure. Conversely, the critical temperature of CaC6 exhibits weak growth in the 0 to 5 GPa range, contrasting experiments showing more significant increases. The study posits a continuous phase transformation, such as a change in staging, occurring in CaC6 at finite pressure. Furthermore, while MgC6 is unstable, synthesizing intercalated systems like MgxCa1-xCy could potentially lead to higher critical temperatures. Through a comprehensive exploration, the research highlights the implementation of density functional theory in examining the superconductivity potential of graphite intercalated with alkaline earth metals, offering insights into the enhancement of its electronic properties and potential for optimizing superconducting materials through tailored intercalation strategies.",
