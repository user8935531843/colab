    "original": "This study introduces an innovative method for building informative sparse polynomial chaos expansions (PCEs) through interpolation based on the Leja sequence. The proposed approach differs from traditional stochastic collocation methods by producing PCEs that feature a single polynomial term per collocation point, ensuring exactness on the interpolation nodes. By leveraging hierarchical basis polynomials defined on Leja sequences, a sparse-grid interpolation is achieved, offering unique multivariate degree basis polynomials. A dimension-adaptive scheme further refines this approach for constructing anisotropic interpolations. The use of Leja nodes enables a seamless transformation to orthogonal polynomials of identical degrees, resulting in an interpolating PCE without the need for hierarchical interpolation and basis transformation steps. Through numerical experiments spanning low to moderately high-dimensional scenarios and diverse input distributions, this approach demonstrates superior accuracy-to-complexity ratio compared to existing methods, showcasing its efficacy in handling nonlinear and high-dimensional problems. By optimizing parameter selection and design considerations, this approach offers a robust solution for various complex engineering and scientific applications, streamlining computational efficiency while maintaining high accuracy levels.",
