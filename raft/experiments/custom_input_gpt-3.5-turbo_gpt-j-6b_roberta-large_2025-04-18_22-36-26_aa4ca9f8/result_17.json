    "original": "The investigation into the fluid and radiation pressure fluctuations in accretion disks during matter infall towards a black hole aims to understand their impact on the flow dynamics. In the vicinity of a black hole, where the flow could exhibit relativistic behavior akin to radiation compared to non-relativistic far-away regions, variations in the gas pressure to total pressure ratio (beta) and the polytropic index (gamma) are expected. Analyzing accretion flows' significant beta and gamma fluctuations demonstrates the need to reevaluate established solutions founded on constant beta assumptions. Exploration of a viscous sub-Keplerian accretion disk surrounding black holes, accounting for advection, pressure gradient, and beta evolution, through numerical simulations delves into the thermo-hydrodynamical properties of the flow. The study reveals substantial beta and gamma variations during infall, impacting disk solutions and offering insights into phenomena like super-luminal jets, luminosity, and fundamental property derivations. The significance of variable beta and gamma in accretion disk dynamics sheds light on the complex interplay between gas and radiation content and their implications for understanding black hole dynamics and celestial observations.",
