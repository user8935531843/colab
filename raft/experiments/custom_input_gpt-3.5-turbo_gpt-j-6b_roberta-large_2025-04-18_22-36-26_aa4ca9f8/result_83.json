    "original": "The reliability of the off-critical line points identified as non-trivial zeros of the Davenport and Heilbronn function is reassessed in response to a previous note published in the journal. The analysis presented in this study reinforces the view that these points are indeed true zeros, rather than affected by approximation errors. Additionally, linear combinations of L-functions adhering to a similar functional equation as the Davenport and Heilbronn function do not serve as counterexamples to the Riemann Hypothesis, contrary to common belief. Expanding on the work of Davenport and Heilbronn, this paper explores a broader class of arithmetic functions and their implications in algebraic number theory. Investigations into the properties of these functions and their interrelations shed light on their applications in Diophantine equations, offering valuable insights into the arithmetic of algebraic numbers and the behavior of functions central to number theory. Analyzing stochastic flows on oriented metric graphs with solutions represented as kernels driven by Brownian motion, this study builds on previous research to examine the dynamics of these flows. By studying how graph topology and edge properties influence transport, particularly of particles under random forces, the research sheds light on optimizing transportation networks and molecular transport in biological systems. The findings have broad applications in understanding and enhancing transportation systems and networks. In the realm of ambient backscatter communications (AmBackComs), the impact of co-channel interference and non-linear energy harvesting behavior at passive backscatter devices (BDs) is often overlooked in performance analyses. This study addresses these aspects by providing a thorough assessment of outage performance in a multi-backscatter link AmBackCom system. By incorporating an adaptive reflection coefficient to minimize outage probability and accounting for co-channel interference on both backscatter and legacy links, the study offers insights into optimizing the performance of AmBackCom systems in interference-limited environments. Exploring the impact of fitting algorithms and observational uncertainties on physical parameter estimation based on Vazdekis/MILES library mock spectra, this study focuses on two full-spectrum fitting codes: pPXF and STARLIGHT. The analysis reveals biases and scatter induced by fitting algorithms, particularly in recovering stellar population parameters. While pPXF shows consistent results with predictable biases, STARLIGHT results are influenced by input reddening value and error spectrum shape. The study provides valuable insights into the performance and efficiency of different full-spectrum fitting algorithms in recovering stellar population parameters. Comparing two full-spectrum fitting algorithms for recovering stellar population parameters in the absence of model uncertainties, this study evaluates the performance of the Penalized Pixel-Fitting (pPXF) method and the Flexible Stellar Population Synthesis (FSPS) model. Analyzing spectra from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, the study demonstrates the superior accuracy and precision of the pPXF method, attributed to its optimization for handling diverse stellar populations and resilience to parameter degeneracies. The findings underscore the importance of selecting appropriate full-spectrum fitting algorithms for optimizing the recovery of stellar population parameters in galaxy evolution studies.",
