    "original": "The concept of supersymmetric Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) models, which involve quantum mechanical models with Majorana fermions, has garnered significant interest due to their chaotic dynamics and non-Fermi liquid behavior. Our study delves into the supersymmetric SYK models, exploring their properties and potential applications in various physics domains. An ${\\cal N}=1$ model examines broken supersymmetry at exact theory levels, contrasting with larger $N$ unbroken supersymmetry. Analyzing the models involves investigating large $N$ equations and conducting numerical computations for smaller $N$ values. Transitioning to an ${\\cal N}=2$ version, the model upholds supersymmetry in the exact theory, with a computed Witten index corroborating the large $N$ entropy computation. Additionally, we explore the supersymmetric extensions of the Schwarzian action, elucidating their effects at lower energies. Through numerical and analytical methods, we unveil the complex phase structures and fascinating phase transitions inherent in supersymmetric SYK models, shedding light on their intricate physics and potential implications in many-body systems.",
