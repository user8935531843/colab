    "original": "The outer halo of M31, a region of interest for astronomers studying dark matter distribution and behavior, was analyzed using Fermi LAT observations in this study. By examining gamma-ray data, it was determined that the excess of gamma rays in the 1-3 GeV range could be attributed to dark matter annihilation. The study yielded a limit on the dark matter mass, with dominant annihilation to b quarks, shedding light on the dark matter distribution within M31's outer halo. Furthermore, the findings align with previous studies on dark matter in galaxies, hinting at a universal distribution pattern. Additional research is needed to explore implications for alternative dark matter models, warranting further observational data in M31 and other galaxy regions to enhance our understanding. This study offers valuable insights into dark matter behavior and distribution in M31's outer halo, propelling advancements in dark matter model development and influencing ongoing detection efforts in various astrophysical contexts.",
