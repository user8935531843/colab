    "original": "In the realm of combinatorics and theoretical computer science, the concept of tournaments, which are directed graphs representing pairwise connections between distinct vertices, is probed. The notion of a {-3}-tournament, where each 3-cycle features a unique chord, signifying a distinctive concatenation of non-adjacent vertices, is explored. In the context of the {-3}-reconstruction conundrum, the objective is to reconstruct a labeled tournament from the collection of lengths of its 3-length paths. Additionally, the concept of {-3}-self duality within tournaments is examined, where tournaments exhibit an automorphism that transforms each vertex into its complement with respect to $\\tau$. A comprehensive analysis unveils requisite conditions for determining if a tournament is a {-3}-tournament, establishes criteria for a multiset of integers to represent the lengths of paths within a {-3}-tournament, and formulates algorithms for reconstructing labeled {-3}-tournaments with precision. The study extends to transitive, regular, and strongly connected tournaments, reinforcing the understanding of tournament structures. Moreover, insights into formulas for the ratio of different types of supernovae and the application of tournament theory to real-world phenomena, such as voting systems and social networks, are illuminated, emphasizing the diverse applications and implications of these frameworks.",
