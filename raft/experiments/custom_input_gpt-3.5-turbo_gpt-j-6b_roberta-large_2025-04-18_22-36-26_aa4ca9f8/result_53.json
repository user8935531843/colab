    "original": "Coalition formation refers to the strategic assembly of independent agents into cohesive groups to effectively pursue their individual or joint objectives, presenting a significant research challenge in multi-agent systems. Evaluating various potential coalitions to discern the optimal selection that maximizes a predefined goal poses a complex task. The calculation entails determining the coalition value for each conceivable group, signifying its potential utility upon formation. This process demands identifying the most beneficial combination of non-overlapping coalitions to yield an optimal system outcome. However, the challenge is substantial due to the exponential growth of potential solutions relative to the number of agents involved. To address this issue, diverse algorithms leveraging dynamic programming, integer programming, and stochastic search techniques have been proposed. In this study, we introduce an anytime algorithm designed to tackle the optimal coalition formation conundrum. The algorithm adopts a unique approach that partitions the solution space into sub-spaces, allowing the computation of upper and lower bounds for optimal coalition structures within each segment. Leveraging these bounds effectively, the algorithm identifies and prunes sub-spaces devoid of potential optimal solutions. Subsequently, a branch-and-bound technique is employed to efficiently navigate the remaining sub-spaces, steering clear of examining redundant or invalid solutions. Our algorithm ensures the comprehensive enumeration of coalition structures by systematically avoiding non-beneficial solutions. Additionally, we introduce a novel input distribution to enhance benchmark reliability, showcasing the algorithm's prowess in delivering efficient solutions. Comparative analysis demonstrates that our algorithm outperforms existing approaches by achieving optimal solutions at a fraction of the time and computational costs. This anytime algorithm, with its robust performance, signifies a breakthrough in analyzing and generating optimal coalition structures, spanning diverse applications from multi-agent systems to organizational management and political science.",
