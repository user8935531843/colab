    "original": "The Sagittarius Dwarf Galaxy, under investigation through 2MASS data, showcases a concentrated core overlaid by an expansive, faint Sagittarius Stream. Notably, the stream displays asymmetry around the core, with a distinct secondary branch in the northwest. By analyzing the red giant branch tip magnitudes and Galactic plane distances, we reveal diverse dwarf galaxy and globular cluster candidates within the Sagittarius Stream, shedding light on the environmental conditions influencing Sagittarius' disruption. Our study elucidates crucial insights into the evolving morphology of Sagittarius' core and tidal arms, providing a deeper understanding of this ongoing cosmic transformation. Additionally, our innovative approach in solving Schrödinger's equation via the Nikiforov-Uvarov method removes previous shortcomings and simplifies the resolution process, showcasing the method's reliability and effectiveness in various fields of physics. Furthermore, the integration of sparse coding in reinforcement learning yields compact and efficient state space representations, offering a promising solution to the challenge of dimensionality in RL applications. Leveraging supervised sparse coding objectives for policy evaluation, our approach outperforms traditional tile-coding methods, demonstrating the potential of sparse coding in enhancing the learning efficiency and performance of RL agents across diverse environments.",
