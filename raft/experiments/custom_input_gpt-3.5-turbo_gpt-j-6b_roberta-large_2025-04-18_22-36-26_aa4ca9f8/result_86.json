    "original": "VCM (Video Coding for Machines) stands at the intersection of video/image compression and feature compression fields, striving to optimize compactness and efficiency for both machine vision accuracy and human vision fidelity. The methodology and philosophy of VCM are summarized based on existing research efforts, illustrating a rate-distortion optimization approach and categorizing key modules and techniques. While prior works have explored scalable representation for machine and human vision tasks, there is a lack of research on low bit rate representation's generality and its support for various visual analytic tasks. This paper delves into the visual information compression for analytics taxonomy problem, enhancing the capacity of compact visual representations for multiple visual analytic tasks. By considering task relationships in compression, the study aims to facilitate multiple machine vision tasks at low bit rates, emphasizing transferability among tasks. Introducing a codebook hyperprior, the study seeks to bridge the dimensionality gap between neural network features and diverse machine vision features, improving feature compression efficiency and enabling finer feature abstraction across tasks. Experimental results demonstrate the potential of this new hyperprior model in enhancing feature compression by accurately estimating signal entropy and exploring compact feature abstraction across different tasks.",
