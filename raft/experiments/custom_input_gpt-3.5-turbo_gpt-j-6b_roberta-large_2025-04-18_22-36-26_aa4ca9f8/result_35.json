    "original": "Through profound studies into supernova remnants (SNRs), we unveil critical insights into the lifecycle of stars, underpinned by detailed optical observations of three specific SNRs: G126.2+1.6, G59.8+1.2, and G54.4-0.3. The primary objective of this study is to delve into the morphology and spectral characteristics of these remnants to shed light on explosion mechanisms and progenitor star properties. Leveraging the 4.2-m William Herschel Telescope (WHT) and the 2.5-m Nordic Optical Telescope (NOT) in La Palma, Spain, we captured images through narrowband filters targeting essential emission lines like H-alpha, [OIII], and [SII]. Our data set was complemented by existing X-ray and radio data to construct a comprehensive multi-wavelength analysis of these remnants. Detailed analyses revealed G126.2+1.6's intricate structure marked by various emission filaments and knots, displaying a prominent H-alpha shell suggestive of ambient gas interaction. Contrarily, G59.8+1.2 and G54.4-0.3 exhibited asymmetrical morphologies, hinting at interactions with adjacent molecular clouds. Furthermore, X-ray and radio data unveiled hot plasma presence and synchrotron emission, unveiling additional clues about explosion mechanisms and progenitor star traits. Spectral assessments identified distinct kinematic properties and ionization structures within the remnants, with observations of broad wings in the H-alpha line of G59.8+1.2 and G54.4-0.3 hinting at potential shocks or turbulence in the surrounding medium. Spatial variations in [OIII]/H-alpha and [SII]/H-alpha ratios suggested fluctuations in gas metallicity and density within the remnants. In essence, the comprehensive optical studies of G126.2+1.6, G59.8+1.2, and G54.4-0.3 SNRs provide novel perspectives into their underlying characteristics, offering valuable contributions towards understanding explosion mechanisms, progenitor star diversities, and the importance of multi-wavelength investigations in studying SNRs.",
