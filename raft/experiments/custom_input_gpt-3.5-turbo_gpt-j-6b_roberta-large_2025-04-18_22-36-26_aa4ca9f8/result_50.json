    "original": "Conducting a search for temporal variations in narrow absorption lines within high-resolution quasar spectra, we constructed a sample involving five distant sources. By analyzing variations in profiles of absorption lines, we investigated their implications in terms of small-scale structures within intervening gas or intrinsic origins. Notably, absorption lines from MgII, FeII, and proxy species exhibited remarkable stability even for systems at z_abs ~ z_e. Marginal variations were observed for MgII lines towards PKS 1229-021 at z_abs = 0.83032, although no significant changes as reported in low-resolution SDSS spectra were detected. Clear variations were observed for Galactic NaI lines towards PKS 1229-02, corresponding to a structure at a scale of about 35 au. Additionally, tentative variations were detected for H2 J=3 lines towards FBQS J2340-0053 at z_abs = 2.05454, suggesting the existence of structure at the 10 au-scale for warm gas. A marginal change was also observed in CI from another velocity component. These findings shed light on the temporal variations of narrow absorption lines in high-resolution quasar spectra, offering insights into the velocity fields and structures of gas clouds along quasar sightlines.",
