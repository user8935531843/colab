    "original": "The growing exploration of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and their variability patterns across different wavelengths has emerged as a significant research area. Optical variability serves as a key factor in identifying AGNs through extensive sky surveys. The effectiveness of optical variability selection techniques in comparison to other multiwavelength methodologies has been a subject of limited examination. This study presents the outcomes of an r-band analysis on a sample of 299 optically variable AGN candidates in the COSMOS field, derived from the VST survey. This dataset spans over three observing seasons, encompassing a period of more than 3 years. By enhancing the depth of analysis to r(AB) ~23.5 mag and leveraging multiple multiwavelength catalogs, the study aims to confirm the nature of AGN candidates and refine the accuracy of the selection method through spectroscopic and photometric diagnostics. Tests are conducted to evaluate the significance of dense sampling in anticipation of forthcoming wide-field surveys. The results showcase the efficacy of the method in generating high-purity samples exceeding 86%. With an extended observing baseline, substantial advancements are achieved in the completeness of the sample relative to X-ray and spectroscopically validated AGN samples, enhancing the inclusivity of unobscured and obscured AGNs. The robustness of the selection technique underscores the need for developing advanced methodologies to handle expansive datasets efficiently. P2: This paper presents a detailed analysis of a translucent interstellar cloud at a redshift of 2.69 located in the line of sight to the quasar SDSS J123714.60+064759.5. By utilizing molecular absorption lines from the quasar spectrum, the column densities of carbon monoxide (CO), molecular hydrogen (H2), and deuterium/hydrogen (HD) are quantified within the interstellar cloud. The measured CO and H2 column densities correspond to a total hydrogen column density consistent with that expected for a translucent cloud. The HD column density serves as a metric for the HD/H2 isotopic ratio, aligning with values observed in the local interstellar medium. The high-resolution quasar spectra and resulting column densities offer valuable insights into the characteristics and evolution of the interstellar medium at high redshifts. The molecular gas within the cloud exhibits intricate kinematics, indicating potential turbulence or gravitational collapse within the cloud structure. By comparing this interstellar cloud to those found in the local universe, the study suggests that the properties of this cloud may represent a population of faint and diffuse clouds not easily observable locally. Expanding research on these high-redshift clouds could provide significant understanding of the interstellar medium's properties and evolution in the early universe.",
