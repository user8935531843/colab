    "original": "In this paper, we introduce a novel quantum circuit optimization tool, QGo, to address the challenges faced in optimizing quantum circuits for scalable operations. QGo operates by converting high-level quantum algorithms into quantum circuits and optimizing them using a hierarchical approach. By starting locally and gradually scaling optimization efforts, QGo demonstrates remarkable scalability in optimizing circuits for large-scale quantum computers with over 150 qubits. Through extensive experimentation, we show that QGo outperforms existing synthesis tools by achieving an average improvement of 30% in circuit depth and 25% in gate count. Additionally, we provide insights into quantum circuit optimization, highlighting the importance of hierarchical optimization and identifying optimization opportunities within common circuit structures. Overall, QGo serves as a powerful tool for efficient quantum circuit optimization, contributing to the goal of making quantum computing more accessible and manageable in various applications. In a separate study, the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) has completed an extensive survey of the extragalactic sky at mid-infrared wavelengths, ranging from 3.4-22 micron. By merging WISE data with optical SDSS data, we offer a detailed understanding of mid-IR extragalactic sources and their unique properties. Our analysis reveals a diverse range of dust emission properties, originating from both active galactic nuclei (AGN) and star-forming galaxies. By employing color-color and color-magnitude diagnostic diagrams, we investigate the distribution and physical origins of mid-IR emission within the extragalactic sky. Notably, we identify distinct populations of AGN-dominated sources and star-forming galaxies with enhanced PAH emission features. Through a comprehensive examination of the clustering properties of these sources, we demonstrate that the spatial distribution of mid-IR-selected sources aligns with a power-law correlation, reminiscent of optically selected galaxies. Moreover, we highlight the potential for mid-IR selection to identify highly accreting and obscured AGN, outperforming optical selection methods in terms of clustering strength. Overall, our study provides valuable insights into the mid-IR extragalactic sky, shedding light on the intricate astrophysical processes within galaxies.",
