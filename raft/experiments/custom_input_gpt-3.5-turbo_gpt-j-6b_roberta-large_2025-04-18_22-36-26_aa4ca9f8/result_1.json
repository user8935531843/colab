    "original": "The study of coupling losses in composite tapes containing superconducting material, such as BSCCO/Ag tapes, reveals crucial insights into the dynamics of magnetic flux penetration and the impact of interfaces between superconducting filaments and normal matrices. Utilizing a.c. susceptibility measurements, researchers examine the dominant role of interfaces and variations in coupling losses under different magnetic field orientations and strengths. The annealing process is shown to significantly affect coupling losses, with annealed tapes exhibiting lower loss values. Furthermore, the orientation of the Ag matrix proves to influence coupling loss, as demonstrated in experiments with both transverse and longitudinal matrix orientations. Numerical simulations validate the experimental findings, shedding light on coupling loss mechanisms in bi-columnar BSCCO/Ag tapes and providing valuable information for practical applications of high-temperature superconductors. On a related note, investigations into Weighted Solyanik Estimates for the Strong Maximal Function highlight the varying ranges of suitable weights for the Solyanik estimates, particularly in dyadic versus non-dyadic contexts. These studies enhance our understanding of the strong maximal function and its utility in harmonic and Fourier analysis, offering new insights and potential applications in mathematics and related fields. Additionally, observations of Betelgeuse during its unique great dimming event in 2019-2020 using SOFIA-EXES spectroscopy reveal significant changes in the star's atmosphere and suggest the formation of a large dust cloud as the primary cause of the dimming event. The observations provide detailed information on the evolution of Betelgeuse's atmosphere during this period, offering valuable contributions to our knowledge of stellar behavior and evolution.",
