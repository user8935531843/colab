    "original": "Investigating the qualitative divergence in the scaling behaviors of hadronic final states in soft versus hard processes of high-energy collisions, this study delves into the anomalous scaling properties. Through an analysis of experimental data from DELPHI on e^+e^- collisions at $E_{cm}=$91.2 GeV, the study underscores the isotropic dynamical fluctuations in e^+e^- collisions as opposed to the anisotropic fluctuations observed in hadron-hadron collision experiments. Monte Carlo simulations using the Jetset7.4 event generator reaffirm this observation. The paper delves into the dynamics of particle production in high-energy collisions by contrasting soft processes, characterized by higher multiplicity, with hard processes that generate more energetic and massive particles. The findings shed light on the production mechanisms in different collision scenarios, offering insights into QCD and enhancing experimental measurement practices.",
