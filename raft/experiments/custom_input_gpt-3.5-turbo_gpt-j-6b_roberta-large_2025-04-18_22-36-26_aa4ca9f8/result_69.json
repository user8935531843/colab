    "original": "The lattice simulations of N=4 supersymmetric Yang--Mills theory at strong coupling yield insight into the behavior of gluon and fermion propagators, showcasing scaling violations in both. In the massless regime, the theory exhibits conformal symmetry, indicative of a weakly coupled regime in the ultraviolet region. The study also delves into the spectrum of asymptotic states, aligning with prior findings from a weak-coupling expansion. These results pave the way for further exploration of strongly coupled conformal field theories through lattice simulations, offering potential insights into the dynamics of the strong nuclear force. Additionally, the paper introduces new solutions of Einstein equations by employing the method of moving frames to model local anisotropies in one and two-dimensional spacetimes. These solutions depict deformations of static spherically symmetric black holes into locally anisotropic configurations, featuring ellipsoidal, toroidal, and cylindrical symmetries. Another class of solutions introduces black holes with oscillating elliptic horizons. This study sheds light on the concept of locally anisotropic black holes within Einstein's theory of gravity, revealing non-vanishing anisotropic parameters that disrupt isotropy at smaller scales, contributing to the diverse structure of black holes. Moreover, an in-depth investigation of NGC 253's halo examines the diffuse X-ray and H-alpha emissions, unveiling statistically significant structure within the X-ray emission on angular scales down to ~10 arcsec. Despite absence of spatial variations in the spectral properties of the diffuse emission across scales ranging from ~400 pc to ~3 kpc, the X-shaped soft X-ray morphology of the superwind aligns with similar X-shaped H-alpha emission extending at least 8 kpc above the galactic plane. The findings reflect various models elucidating spatially-correlated X-ray and H-alpha emissions in starburst galaxy halos, underlining the integral link between X-ray-emitting hot gas and much cooler, denser gas realms within these galaxies. Underlying the diffuse X-ray emission in halos of starburst galaxies, the study utilizes Chandra observations to assess mechanisms contributing to X-ray emission and corresponding morphological complexity. The spectral properties of the diffuse emission suggest a combination of hot gas and supernova remnants as sources of X-ray emission across various halo regions, where a dominant hot gas component prevails in central and western sectors, while supernova remnants feature prominently in northern and eastern regions. This work uncovers nuanced differences in physical conditions across halo, disk, and central regions of NGC 253, highlighting the interplay between galactic outflows and inflows in influencing halo morphology. Advancements in understanding the diffuse X-ray emission in the halos of starburst galaxies lay the foundation for further investigation into this essential astronomical phenomenon.",
