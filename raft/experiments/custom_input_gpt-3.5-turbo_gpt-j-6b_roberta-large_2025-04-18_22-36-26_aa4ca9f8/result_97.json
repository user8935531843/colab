    "original": "Decoherence in superconducting quantum bit circuits is a significant challenge, disrupting the stability and performance of these circuits for quantum computing applications. By investigating the impact of environmental factors on circuit components, we demonstrate the detrimental effects of decoherence and propose strategies to combat it through circuit optimization. Our analysis highlights the necessity of designing robust superconducting quantum bit circuits to ensure reliable quantum computing operations. In a separate study, we explore a dissipative gauge theory of nonrelativistic fermions and its behavior in the presence of impurity effects. Our findings reveal that impurity-induced instabilities disrupt the non-Fermi-liquid behavior of the system, resulting in a crossover phenomenon at intermediate energy scales. This study sheds light on the intricate relationship between impurity effects and the stability of theoretical non-Fermi-liquid fixed points in fermionic systems, offering valuable insights into their physical implications. Additionally, we delve into the realm of Fuzzy Dark Matter (FDM) models, investigating the evolution of FDM structures within a cosmological framework using high-resolution simulations. Our analysis elucidates how cosmological factors influence the properties and scaling relations of FDM haloes, shedding light on the dynamics and interactions of FDM structures in the universe. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of FDM behavior and its implications for cosmological models and observations. Lastly, we delve into the excess emission observed in the nearby spiral galaxy M33, analyzing the contributions of star-forming and diffuse interstellar medium components to the observed spectral energy distribution. Our modeling efforts reveal discrepancies in the submillimeter and millimeter wavelengths, pointing to unexpected dust properties in M33 as a potential explanation. By scrutinizing the excess emission and physical properties of M33, our study offers insights into the complex nature of astrophysical observations and their implications for galaxy formation and evolution.",
