"The study of coupling losses in composite tapes containing superconducting material, such as BSCCO/Ag tapes, reveals crucial insights into the dynamics of magnetic flux penetration and the impact of interfaces between superconducting filaments and normal matrices. Utilizing a.c. susceptibility measurements, researchers examine the dominant role of interfaces and variations in coupling losses under different magnetic field orientations and strengths. The annealing process is shown to significantly affect coupling losses, with annealed tapes exhibiting lower loss values. Furthermore, the orientation of the Ag matrix proves to influence coupling loss, as demonstrated in experiments with both transverse and longitudinal matrix orientations. Numerical simulations validate the experimental findings, shedding light on coupling loss mechanisms in bi-columnar BSCCO/Ag tapes and providing valuable information for practical applications of high-temperature superconductors.

"Kink magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves have been observed in solar atmospheric magnetic structures, potentially contributing to coronal heating and aiding in solar plasma diagnosis. In order to depict the kink MHD wave emission of a coronal loop, we map the kink MHD wave solution of a plasma cylinder onto a semi-torus structure to mimic a curved coronal loop. Through this approach, we identify a quasi-rigid kink motion and a quadrupole term dominating within and outside the flux tube, respectively. The interplay of these terms leads to periodic intensity variations, modulating the integrated intensity and effective loop width. By studying the generated synthetic views of standing kink modes, based on numerical simulations incorporating plasma properties like density, temperature, and magnetic field strength, we gain deeper insights into their spatial and temporal behavior in coronal loops. Additionally, the influence of energy distribution on stability and evolution of these modes is investigated, shedding light on the underlying physical mechanisms driving their dynamics. This research presents novel perspectives on standing kink modes in coronal loops, offering valuable contributions to forward modeling techniques. Dust transport and deposition patterns behind larger boulders on comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko have been observed by the Rosetta mission. Our study introduces a mechanism for dust transport vectors based on a homogenous surface activity model accounting for the topography of the comet. By integrating gravitational effects, gas drag, and Coriolis force, specific dust transfer pathways are derived, channeling dust to near nucleus coma with higher velocities. A global dust-transport map of 67P/C-G is generated through the distribution of dust sources across the cometary surface, aligning with the reported wind-tail directions in the Philae descent area. The prevalence of distinct dust-transport directions on comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko is explored, correlating these patterns with local topography to enhance our understanding of dust dynamics on comets and surface evolution. A novel millimeter wave diagnostic is proposed for measuring local magnetic fields and edge current with minor radius variation in the tokamak pedestal region. By identifying the minimum reflectivity direction at the O-mode cutoff layer, the magnetic field vector at the cutoff layer can be deduced. Full-wave finite-element simulations verify the minimal reflectivity dependance on the magnetic field at the cutoff, confirming its feasibility for diagnostic purposes. Utilizing O-X mode conversion and oblique reflectometry imaging, this anti-radar diagnostic method demonstrates promise for detecting magnetic fields in diverse plasma environments with high accuracy and spatial resolution.

"In-depth analysis of high-dispersion spectra centered around the Li 6708 A line has been conducted for 70 potential members of the open cluster NGC 3680, focusing on stars in the turnoff region. A measurable Li abundance was determined for 53 stars, with 39 showing radial velocities and proper motions indicative of cluster membership. Following normalization to common temperature and abundance scales, previous Li estimations were consolidated, resulting in a sample of 49 members, with 40 encompassing the cluster Li-dip. Spectroscopic elemental analysis of 8 giants and 5 turnoff stars indicated [Fe/H] = -0.17 +/- 0.07 (sd) and -0.07 +/- 0.02 (sd), respectively. Synthesizing Ca, Si, and Ni measurements revealed values consistent with scaled-solar ratios. Comparison with Y^2 isochrone models yielded an age of 1.75 +/- 0.10 Gyr and an apparent modulus of (m-M) = 10.30 +/- 0.15 for the cluster, locating the Li-dip center at 1.35 +/- 0.03 solar masses. Notably, 5 out of 9 giant cluster members were found to exhibit measurable Li with A(Li) close to 1.0, contributing to a comprehensive understanding of lithium abundance in NGC 3680. Additionally, a correlational analysis pointed to age-driven lithium depletion in post-main sequence stars, underscoring the impact of stellar evolution on lithium content.

"This study investigates the generation of 4-dimensional gauge theories and gravity at low energy from 3-dimensional theories at high energy using the fermion condensation mechanism proposed by Arkani-Hamed, Cohen, and Georgi. By multiple copies of 3-dimensional theories, 4-dimensional Einstein gravity is produced in reference to two-form gravity. The 3-dimensional Einstein action without matter coupling being topological, our model exhibits less singular ultraviolet divergences. Introducing matter fermions on a discrete lattice following Wilson, 4-dimensional gauge interactions are accurately derived from 3-dimensional theories, even in left-right asymmetric standard model theories. To achieve this, fermion condensates should generate Higgs fields and gauge fields of the extra dimension. The prospect of generating the 4-dimensional standard model from multiple 3-dimensional counterparts is promising. In addressing the doubling problem in the weak interaction sector, discrete lattices are introduced separately for left- and right-handed sectors, along with the generation of two types of Higgs fields. We explore the interplay between 4-dimensional gauge theory and gravity emanating from 3-dimensional theories at high energy, delving into the dualities between these theories and their implications for understanding fundamental physics. Utilizing tools from holography and quantum field theory, we present evidence for these dualities, underscoring their significance in describing strongly coupled systems. This work offers new insights into the nature of gravity and its relationship with gauge theory, potentially opening new avenues for research in theoretical physics. Additionally, we explore the role of the holographic principle and its connection to spacetime geometry emergence. Our study illuminates the deep connections between seemingly disparate theories, providing a framework for investigating high-energy system behavior and making striking advancements in unifying fundamental forces of nature.","This study investigates the generation of 4-dimensional gauge theories and gravity at low energy from 3-dimensional theories at high energy using the fermion condensation mechanism proposed by Arkani-Hamed, Cohen, and Georgi.

"Research in diffuse intracluster light (ICL) and cD galaxy halos underscores their close association with galaxy evolution and disruption. A recent kinematic analysis of the ICL within the core of the Hydra I cluster utilized planetary nebulas (PNs) as tracers, revealing intriguing insights into the phenomenon. Employing a multi-slit imaging spectroscopy approach on VLT-UT1, 56 PNs linked to diffuse light were identified in the central region of Hydra I. Observations of these PNs included measurements of their [OIII] magnitudes, sky positions, and line-of-sight velocity distributions (LOSVD), which were juxtaposed against the phase-space distribution of neighboring galaxies. Notably, the observed PNs exhibited a luminosity function consistent with expectations at a distance of ~50 Mpc. The reduced number density of the detected PNs relative to anticipated values suggests potential ram pressure stripping by the hot ICM. The LOSVD histogram of the PNs unveiled a non-Gaussian, multipeaked distribution, with a predominant broad central component and two distinct narrower peaks at 1800 km/s and 5000 km/s. The primary component resonated with the extant intracluster halo of NGC 3311, showcasing congruence in velocities. Conversely, galaxies within the 100 x 100 kpc^2 core region were conspicuously devoid of velocities corresponding to the latter two peaks, implying plausible earlier disruption events nurturing this component. The PNs correlating with the 5000 km/s peak spatially and in velocities align with a group of dwarf galaxies in the MSIS field, signifying a potential connection to ongoing tidal interactions. The partial phase mixing of diffuse light within the Hydra I core hints at continuous intracluster halo development and a dynamically warm cD halo encircling NGC 3311.

"This study outlines a proposal for the development of a cutting-edge inverse-geometry spallation-driven ultracold neutron (UCN) source with a vast array of scientific and technological applications, from fundamental neutron physics to materials science. The proposed source capitalizes on a high-power proton accelerator to induce neutron production via the spallation process, followed by channeling these neutrons into a UCN converter to generate UCNs through extreme cooling. The UCNs are intended for utilization in diverse experiments. The proposed source boasts a high UCN production rate, capable of surpassing existing sources by more than two orders of magnitude, thus enabling the execution of experiments not previously feasible. Another significant advantage of the proposed source is its flexibility; thanks to the inverse-geometry design, easy reconfiguration is possible for diverse experiments. Moreover, the high-energy proton beam utilized in the spallation process can be finely tuned to produce neutrons with specific energies and spectra, broadening the scope of experiment possibilities. The paper elaborates on the conceptual design of the proposed source, encompassing the accelerator, target, UCN converter, and experimental areas while factoring in the scientific requirements and prevailing technological constraints. Furthermore, the ongoing R&D endeavors aimed at developing the various components of the proposed system are discussed. Ultimately, the proposal highlights the potential for a next-generation inverse-geometry spallation-driven ultracold neutron source capable of delivering high UCN production rates and experimental adaptability, poised to significantly progress neutron physics and materials science, with promising prospects for successful implementation. This study delves into dmB, a novel metric disassociated from distance and extinction, aimed at quantifying the contribution of stellar populations exceeding 9 Gyr to the average r-band surface brightness of the bulge component in 135 late-type galaxies (LTGs) sourced from the CALIFA survey with a substantial mass range. The core finding indicates that LTG bulges follow a continuous sequence of heightened dmB corresponding to growing M*T, M*B, stellar mass surface density S*, mass-weighted age, and metallicity, where older, denser, and massive bulges exhibit elevated dmB values. Additionally, an increase in bulge-to-disk age and metallicity disparities, and the bulge-to-disk mass ratio is observed with rising M*T. Notably, high-mass, high-S* bulges exclusively exhibit LINER- and Seyfert-specific emission-line ratios in place of usual star formation (SF) prevalence seen in lower-mass bulges. The coherence in LTG bulge properties and the relative age and metallicity contrasts with parent disks suggest a concurrent evolutionary pathway bestowing continuous physical and developmental attributes. The study aligns with a narrative wherein bulge expansion in LTGs is steered by a blend of rapid-early and gradual-secular processes, wherein the latter gains prominence with increasing M*T. These processes, comprising in situ SF concentrated in the bulge coupled with inward disk material migration, are anticipated to drive non-homologous S* radial expansion paralleled by an amplified Sersic index correlating with growing galaxy mass.","This study outlines a proposal for the development of a cutting-edge inverse-geometry spallation-driven ultracold neutron (UCN) source with a vast array of scientific and technological applications, from fundamental neutron physics to materials science.

"High-resolution spectroscopic observations of a decaying sunspot were conducted using the Solar Optical Telescope on board the Hinode satellite. The study focused on NOAA 10944, situated on the solar surface from March 2 to March 4, 2007. The observations revealed the presence of umbral dots (UDs) within the umbra region, characterized by their size and magnetic structures. Magnitudes of magnetic field strength, inclination angle, and Doppler velocity around UDs exhibited center-to-limb variations. UDs located at disk center displayed slightly weaker magnetic fields and relative blue shifts compared to their surroundings. However, minimal differences were observed in the magnetic and Doppler values of UDs and their surroundings as the sunspot approached the limb. This center-to-limb variation is attributed to a cusp-shaped magnetized atmosphere surrounding UDs, resulting from weakly magnetized hot gas intrusions. Some UDs exhibited oscillatory light curves with multiple peaks around 10 minutes, indicating potential oscillatory convection. The results are discussed within the frameworks of theoretical models such as the monolithic model and the field-free intrusion model. Through advanced observations and analyses, the magnetic nature of UDs rooted in unipolar regions with a weak magnetic field is elucidated, shedding light on their potential role in energy transport and magnetism within sunspots. The implications underscore the importance of understanding the dynamics and magnetic properties of small dark features like UDs to advance knowledge on the Sun's magnetic structures and energy transport processes.

In the realm of particle physics, the evaluation of central black-hole masses within luminous quasars provides critical insights into AGN black-hole masses across varying nuclear luminosities. By combining estimates from quasar black holes with those from Seyfert galaxies, we investigate the correlation between black hole mass and bulge luminosity. Notably, our results indicate a consistent Mblack-Mbulge relation across quasars and Seyfert galaxies, with radio-loud quasars exhibiting significantly larger black-hole masses than their radio-quiet counterparts. Through a comparative analysis with the elliptical galaxy fundamental plane, we derive virial H-beta black hole masses to inform the black-hole vs. bulge mass relation, corroborating our findings with Mblack-sigma correlations.

"The recent discovery of three new gas giant exoplanets (WASP-151b, WASP-153b, and WASP-156b) has provided insights into giant planet migration and the Neptunian desert boundary. Using precise radial velocity measurements from the WASP survey and follow-up observations by the SOPHIE spectrograph, researchers investigated the migration patterns of these gas giants in close-in orbits. WASP-151b, with a mass of 0.77 Jupiter masses and a short orbital period, presents a valuable case study for understanding migration processes. Furthermore, WASP-153b and WASP-156b's placement beyond the Neptunian desert challenges existing beliefs about planetary mass-radius space and raises questions about detection limits. The discoveries of these exoplanets highlight the need to refine migration and formation models to account for observations beyond current boundaries. VCC 510, a dwarf elliptical galaxy, has intrigued astronomers due to its unique counter-rotating core, rotating in the opposite direction to the galaxy's main body. An analysis of photometric and kinematic data reveals that the counter-rotating core likely resulted from a major merger event about 4 billion years ago. This event introduced a gas-rich secondary galaxy into a collision with VCC 510, triggering star formation and forming a distinctive core structure. Observations indicate that the counter-rotating core exhibits disk-like characteristics and suggests a complex merging history for VCC 510, contributing valuable insights into dwarf galaxy formation and evolution processes. On a different note, the Hyades stream has long been considered a dispersed remnant of the Hyades cluster. However, recent research suggests that the stream is comprised of trapped orbits at a resonance of a density disturbance rather than dispersed cluster members. By studying the chemical compositions of stars in the Hyades stream, researchers found that while some stars have origins in the cluster, others do not, supporting the resonant scenario. The presence of similar chemical compositions in some Hyades stream stars aligns with a cluster origin, providing evidence of a connection between the stream and the Hyades cluster. This study emphasizes the utility of chemical tagging in tracing stellar origins and clarifying the relationship between the Hyades stream and the Hyades cluster.","The recent discovery of three new gas giant exoplanets (WASP-151b, WASP-153b, and WASP-156b) has provided insights into giant planet migration and the Neptunian desert boundary.

The intricate relationship between the bit depth and the requisite number of measurements for precise signal recovery remains a subject of scholarly inquiry. A comprehensive analysis is presented in this paper, exploring the impact of bit depth and measurement quantity on signal recovery quality. Leveraging the principles of compressed sensing, a framework capitalizing on signal sparsity in specific basis domains, we introduce a groundbreaking recovery algorithm that capitalizes on the structure of linear signals for accurate recovery from quantized linear measurements.

"The growing exploration of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and their variability patterns across different wavelengths has emerged as a significant research area. Optical variability serves as a key factor in identifying AGNs through extensive sky surveys. The effectiveness of optical variability selection techniques in comparison to other multiwavelength methodologies has been a subject of limited examination. This study presents the outcomes of an r-band analysis on a sample of 299 optically variable AGN candidates in the COSMOS field, derived from the VST survey. This dataset spans over three observing seasons, encompassing a period of more than 3 years. By enhancing the depth of analysis to r(AB) ~23.5 mag and leveraging multiple multiwavelength catalogs, the study aims to confirm the nature of AGN candidates and refine the accuracy of the selection method through spectroscopic and photometric diagnostics. Tests are conducted to evaluate the significance of dense sampling in anticipation of forthcoming wide-field surveys. The results showcase the efficacy of the method in generating high-purity samples exceeding 86%. With an extended observing baseline, substantial advancements are achieved in the completeness of the sample relative to X-ray and spectroscopically validated AGN samples, enhancing the inclusivity of unobscured and obscured AGNs. The robustness of the selection technique underscores the need for developing advanced methodologies to handle expansive datasets efficiently. P2: This paper presents a detailed analysis of a translucent interstellar cloud at a redshift of 2.69 located in the line of sight to the quasar SDSS J123714.60+064759.5. By utilizing molecular absorption lines from the quasar spectrum, the column densities of carbon monoxide (CO), molecular hydrogen (H2), and deuterium/hydrogen (HD) are quantified within the interstellar cloud. The measured CO and H2 column densities correspond to a total hydrogen column density consistent with that expected for a translucent cloud. The HD column density serves as a metric for the HD/H2 isotopic ratio, aligning with values observed in the local interstellar medium. The high-resolution quasar spectra and resulting column densities offer valuable insights into the characteristics and evolution of the interstellar medium at high redshifts. The molecular gas within the cloud exhibits intricate kinematics, indicating potential turbulence or gravitational collapse within the cloud structure. By comparing this interstellar cloud to those found in the local universe, the study suggests that the properties of this cloud may represent a population of faint and diffuse clouds not easily observable locally.

"We propose a new method for determining the local value of the Hubble constant by calibrating the Tip of the Red Giant Branch (TRGB) on Type Ia supernovae. Our analysis yields a value of Ho = 69.8 +/- 0.8 km/sec/Mpc. The TRGB method is highly precise and accurate, independently verifying the Cepheid distance scale. Our calculated value aligns with current Hubble tension levels and shows agreement with the Planck 2018 estimate and the SHoES measurement based on Cepheid distances. We measure TRGB distances using deep Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) imaging of galaxy halos and anchor these distances using the Carnegie Supernova Project I sample. Comparatively, TRGB distances offer advantages over Cepheid variables, including reduced halo reddening, minimal photometry interference, and less sensitivity to metallicity. By leveraging TRGB distances, we expand our understanding of the Universe's fundamental properties, contributing to the ongoing efforts to enhance cosmological knowledge. We present a study on the spectral properties of the linear operator $\mathcal{L}\_{\Omega}+a$ in $C(\bar\Omega)$, focusing on the generalised principal eigenvalue $\lambda\_p(\mathcal{L}\_{\Omega}+a)$. We establish the equivalence of different definitions of the principal eigenvalue and analyze its behavior with respect to scaling $K$. Specifically, for kernels characterized by $K(x,y)=J(x-y)$, we investigate asymptotic properties of $\lambda\_{p} \left(\mathcal{L}\_{\sigma,m,\Omega} -\frac{1}{\sigma^m}+a\right)$. Our analysis demonstrates that the principal eigenvalue is a crucial property to understand the operator's behavior and how it scales with varying parameters. We also provide insights into the convergence properties of the corresponding eigenfunction, shedding light on the broader understanding of spectral properties of nonlocal operators.","We propose a new method for determining the local value of the Hubble constant by calibrating the Tip of the Red Giant Branch (TRGB) on Type Ia supernovae.

"Heart rate variability (HRV) analysis is vital in assessing the autonomic nervous system, yielding valuable insights into health conditions. HRV data often exhibit aperiodic non-stationarity, necessitating detrending to mitigate low-frequency influences. Linear detrending minimally impacts global RR data characteristics, preserving SDNN distributions. In contrast, nonlinear detrending alters the complexity and order among different RR data types. Notably, SDNN distinctions between normal sinus rhythm and ventricular premature beats diminish post nonlinear detrending. Consequently, nonlinearly detrended RR data display similar complexity signatures, akin to random signals. While linear detrending remains inconsequential in analysis, nonlinear detrending's impact necessitates caution, demanding complementary techniques to preserve data dynamics. Nonlinear trend removal is crucial for accurate HRV analysis, particularly using EEMD or SSA for effective detrending. Careful evaluation post-trend removal ensures interpretation accuracy in HRV analysis, showcasing its critical role in clinical decision-making. Centrality measures play a pivotal role in quantifying node importance in complex networks. Traditional centrality measures may not capture limited interaction ranges in real-world scenarios. To address this, range-limited centrality measures are introduced, encompassing limited-degree and limited-betweenness centrality. These measures efficiently quantify node importance within specified interaction ranges and adapt effectively to range parameter variations. Experimental evaluations demonstrate the superiority of range-limited centrality measures over standard measures in capturing node importance in range-limited networks. Application of these measures to disease spread and information flow in networks reveals their efficacy in identifying critical nodes facilitating disease dissemination and information transmission.

"The research paper explores the dynamics of D-branes and presents the standard action for fundamental and stacked D-branes, derived using a world-sheet approach. D-branes are defined as sub-manifolds where open strings terminate, with properties such as tension and charge. The Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) action is introduced to describe the coupling between D-branes and background fields. Utilizing this action, the standard action for single and stacked D-branes is derived under the Born approximation. The standard action is shown to be invariant under world-sheet reparameterizations and background field symmetries, with implications for phenomena like D-brane scattering and interactions with closed string modes. Emphasis is placed on understanding D-brane dynamics in string theory, providing a foundational tool for investigating D-brane behavior in diverse backgrounds and applications like brane inflation and the AdS/CFT correspondence. Additionally, the study discusses the blue-shifted broad absorption lines observed in Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) due to high-speed outflows, shedding light on internal structure obscurement by the AGN torus. Recent observations reveal rotation in the outflow of the BAL quasar PG 1700+518, supporting its accretion disc origin. High-resolution VLBI observations alongside archival VLA data reveal the jet structure of PG 1700+518 on parsec to kiloparsec scales, identifying distinctive features like a kpc-scale hot spot and a compact jet component. The symmetric nature of the two-sided jet feature suggests a jet axis far from the line of sight, inclined at approximately 45 degrees, supported by a resemblance to polar-scattered Seyfert galaxies. The study enriches understanding of AGN properties, highlighting the radio characteristics of PG 1700+518 and its implications for AGN evolution and feedback mechanisms.

"The study of scalar curvature flow involves exploring changes in the scalar curvature of a space over time, with a particular focus on regions with zero scalar curvature that remain flat throughout the flow. Results indicate that solutions to the flow tend to converge exponentially towards a Ricci-flat metric in areas where the scalar curvature is initially non-zero. Furthermore, the boundedness of scalar curvature during the flow is established, along with an explicit formula for the maximum scalar curvature attained throughout the evolution.

"In analyzing Supernovae Ia (SNe Ia) through observations with the UVOT instrument on the Swift satellite, a structured pattern in the UV-OPT color discrepancies of normal SNe has been illuminated. We scrutinize UV-OPT color data from 25 SNe Ia, classifying them into 4 distinct groups, with approximately 1/3 displaying bluer UV-OPT shades compared to the predominant group, known as ""NUV-red"" SNe Ia. These ""NUV-blue"" SNe Ia exhibit a 0.4 mag difference in u-v colors compared to their ""NUV-red"" counterparts. Another subgroup showcases color resemblances to ""NUV-red"" SNe Ia in the u-v to uvw1-v colors but aligns more closely with the ""NUV-blue"" SNe Ia in uvm2-v hues, coined as ""MUV-blue"". A final cluster initially demonstrates similarities to ""NUV-red"" SNe Ia, albeit with more modest color transitions compared to the dominant NUV-red group, denoting the ""irregular"" events.

After segregating these groups and accounting for the rapid temporal shift in UV-OPT colors, we observe that the variance in two NUV-OPT colors, u-v & uvw1-v, is consistent with the scatter in b-v colors. This discovery holds significant promise for pushing the boundaries of cosmological applications of SNe Ia into the near-ultraviolet spectrum. By delving into spectrophotometry data of SNe Ia studied using the Hubble Space Telescope, we unveil a fundamental spectral distinction within the 2900-3500A wavelength range, dominated by iron-peak element absorption.

"The study focuses on the local LIRG, IRAS 04296+2923, a barred spiral galaxy situated in the Galactic plane. Despite its location, it stands out as one of the closest LIRGs, surpassing the infrared luminosity of M82 and the Antennae galaxies. The galaxy is a prime example of a nuclear starburst stemming from bar-mediated secular evolution. Utilizing Palomar J and Pa beta images, VLA maps, Keck LWS images, OVRO CO and ^13CO data, as well as 2.7 mm continuum images, the study unveils a symmetric barred spiral in the J-band image. Two compact mid-IR/radio sources at the nucleus represent a starburst equivalent to 10^5 O7 stars, likely forming a pair of young super star clusters separated by 30pc. The nuclear starburst in IRAS 04296+2923 is birthing stars at a rate of ~12Msun/year, contributing half of the galaxy's total star formation rate of ~25Msun/year. Notably, the inner half kpc of IRAS 04296+2923 showcases considerable brightness in CO emissions, marking it as one of the most gas-rich galaxies in the local universe. The CO luminosity equivalent to the entire Milky Way extends over a 15""(2 kpc) region, while the nuclear starburst is localized at ~1-2""(150-250 pc) from the dynamical center. The study indicates that the CO conversion factor in the nucleus is three to four times higher than the Galactic standard, typical of gas-rich spiral nuclei. Furthermore, the study calculates a star formation efficiency of M_gas/SFR^nuc = 2.7x10^-8 yr^-1, implying a gas consumption timescale of tau_SF^nuc~4x10^7 yrs, contrasting with the disk's tau_SF^disk~3.3x10^8 yrs. The analysis suggests that the low absolute star formation efficiency in the disk indicates that the molecular gas is not fully consumed before migrating to the nucleus, fueling a sustained nuclear starburst.

Yet, AEW proves optimal under the ""Bernstein condition"" on the dictionary, showcasing superior functionality in the low-temperature regime. Essentially, the complexity term under this condition corresponds to the logarithm of the set of ""almost minimizers,"" rather than a count of the entire dictionary.

"We conducted a spectroscopic analysis of late-M, L, and T dwarfs from UKIDSS to investigate peculiar objects and unresolved binaries. Utilizing the YJHK photometry from ULAS and red-optical photometry from SDSS, we selected 262 brown dwarf candidates and followed up on 196 of them using X-shooter on the VLT. The experiments revealed 22 blue L dwarfs, 2 blue T dwarfs, and 2 low gravity M dwarfs, aside from identifying 27 unresolved binary candidates. Further spectral deconvolution was done to determine the spectral type of the potential components. Measuring the equivalent width of absorption features and correlating the spectra with radial velocity standards, we determined the distribution of the sample, centered at -1.7±1.2 km s^-1 with a dispersion of 31.5 km s^-1. We inferred the space density of field brown dwarfs based on our spectral data, with varying densities in the L4-L6.5, L7-T0.5, and T1-T4.5 ranges. An elevated density in the L/T transition suggests a potential higher binary fraction or differential environments for objects within this transition zone, pointing towards varying Initial Mass Functions. This study provides a thorough examination of a significant sample of L and T dwarfs, highlighting peculiar objects, binaries, and estimating space density. In a separate study, we delved into the molecular gas properties of the nuclear regions of six nearby galaxies using high-resolution observations from the VLT's SINFONI instrument. Our two-dimensional distributions of warm molecular and ionized gas unveiled diverse morphologies like bar- and ring-like distributions, varying emission characteristics, and non-coincident gas distributions. Thermal processes were identified as the main excitation mechanism for H2 in the nuclear and circumnuclear regions, irrespective of active nuclei presence. Rescaling of the H2 2.12 microns emission line luminosity provided total molecular gas mass estimates. Large amounts of molecular gas mass were observed in the galaxies' centers, with total masses ranging from 10^5 - 10^8 solar masses.

Utilizing the YJHK photometry from ULAS and red-optical photometry from SDSS, we selected 262 brown dwarf candidates and followed up on 196 of them using X-shooter on the VLT. The experiments revealed 22 blue L dwarfs, 2 blue T dwarfs, and 2 low gravity M dwarfs, aside from identifying 27 unresolved binary candidates. Further spectral deconvolution was done to determine the spectral type of the potential components. Measuring the equivalent width of absorption features and correlating the spectra with radial velocity standards, we determined the distribution of the sample, centered at -1.7±1.2 km s^-1 with a dispersion of 31.5 km s^-1. We inferred the space density of field brown dwarfs based on our spectral data, with varying densities in the L4-L6.5, L7-T0.5, and T1-T4.5 ranges.

"This study explores the impact of magnetic field orientation on the launching of jets in binary neutron star mergers utilizing magnetohydrodynamic simulations in general relativity. The orientation of the magnetic field significantly influences the dynamics and stability of the jet launching process, determining the speed and stability of the resulting jets. Our findings reveal that aligned magnetic fields lead to faster and more stable jet formations, while anti-aligned magnetic fields hinder the launching process, resulting in slower and less stable jets. Additionally, the magnetic field affects the global accretion flow of the merger, influencing the accretion rate and the location of the accretion shock, which in turn impacts the jet launch and evolution. The study also examines the correlation between magnetic field strength and jet launch properties, demonstrating that stronger magnetic fields produce faster and more stable jets. These results provide valuable insights into the phenomena associated with binary neutron star mergers and shed light on the jet launching process with broad astrophysical implications.","This study explores the impact of magnetic field orientation on the launching of jets in binary neutron star mergers utilizing magnetohydrodynamic simulations in general relativity.

"Acoustic-prosodic entrainment is a phenomenon in spoken dialogue where individuals align their speech patterns during conversation. This behavior plays a vital role in the success of communication interactions. To effectively model this subtle form of entrainment, we introduce a new definition for local entrainment in speech and develop an algorithm to quantify it. Our method utilizes acoustic-prosodic features to measure entrainment by comparing conversations between real partners to artificially generated conversations. By analyzing the differences in speech features on a turn-by-turn basis, we project the data onto a feature subspace that maximizes the distinction between real and artificial conversations. Using these derived features, we train a Naive Bayes classifier to predict conversational success levels. Our approach achieves a classification accuracy of 72%, outperforming existing methods on a dataset of task-oriented conversations. This research sheds light on the significance of entrainment in spoken communication and provides a novel and effective methodology for its measurement. Artificial intelligence algorithms have the potential to exhibit bias, perpetuating societal inequalities. ""Human-in-the-loop"" approaches, which involve human intervention in algorithmic processes to detect and mitigate biases, are gaining attention. However, little research has been done on how different presentation styles can impact the effectiveness of these approaches. This study explores the impact of presentation style on human detection of algorithmic bias and feedback elicitation. By conducting an experiment using various presentation styles on a dataset with potentially biased labels, we provide preliminary findings suggesting that certain presentation styles may be more successful in detecting bias and prompting feedback from human operators. These results could inform the design of future human-in-the-loop approaches and enhance efforts to detect and address algorithmic bias effectively. The proliferation of obfuscated software has presented challenges for software security practitioners. Compiler-based obfuscation is widely used, with methods being injected at the compiler level. In this paper, we present a generic approach for deobfuscating and recompiling obfuscated code utilizing the LLVM compiler framework. By lifting binary code to the LLVM intermediate language, recover the control flow graph of obfuscated functions using an iterative control flow graph construction algorithm based on compiler optimizations and SMT solving. Our approach leverages strong compiler optimizations available in LLVM and Souper Optimizer to simplify obfuscated code. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in weakening or eliminating obfuscation techniques typically used by commercial obfuscators. The deobfuscated LLVM-IR can be further processed with custom deobfuscation passes at the same level as obfuscation techniques or recompiled with existing LLVM backends. This work is implemented in SATURN, a deobfuscation tool designed to aid in analyzing and understanding obfuscated code.

"This study investigates the conical refraction of hydromagnetic waves in plasma with anisotropic thermal pressure, exploring the propagation characteristics of such waves in a magnetoplasma featuring a non-Maxwellian particle distribution. The results reveal that the direction and shape of the waves are significantly influenced by the anisotropic thermal pressure, with potential implications for plasma physics and astrophysical phenomena. Model-based design offers a systematic approach to developing reliable and secure cyber-physical systems (CPSs) by constructing mathematically precise models of the system and conducting thorough correctness analyses before generating the implementation from the model.

"The study delves into analyzing the sizes of dropout galaxy candidates in the redshift range of z~7-12, utilizing deep images from the UDF12 campaign. With enhanced S/N ratio from the UDF12 imaging, the sizing measurements for known galaxies at z=6.5-8 in the HUDF are significantly improved. By stacking the deep F140W image with existing F125W data, enhanced half-light radii measurements for z-dropouts are obtained. Similarly, stacking this image with the deep UDF12 F160W image provides updated size measurements for a sample of Y-dropouts. A significant milestone enabled by the UDF12 data is the establishment of the first robust galaxy sample in the HUDF at z>8, extending the average galaxy size measurements to higher redshifts. Restricting size measurements to sources now detected at >15sigma, the study reaffirms previous findings regarding the extremely small average half-light radii of z~7-12 galaxies, akin to giant molecular associations in local star-forming galaxies. Additionally, a clear trend of decreasing half-light radius with increasing redshift is noted, with evidence that this trend extends beyond z~8. Modeling the evolution of average half-light radius as a power-law (1+z)^s yields a best-fit index of s=-1.28+/-0.13 over the redshift range z~4-12, aligning with expectations for baryons embedded in constant mass or velocity dark halos. A size-luminosity relationship similar to lower redshift findings is evident in both z- and Y-dropout samples, suggesting a surface density of star formation between 0.05-1.0L*_z. In a revolutionary study, key findings regarding the sizes of galaxies at redshifts 7 < z < 12 are presented using data from the 2012 Hubble Ultra Deep Field Campaign. Leveraging visual inspection and photometric measurements, robust measurements for 212 galaxies confidently detected at z > 7 are reported. A notable decrease in galaxy sizes from z ≃ 12 to z ≃ 7 is observed, supporting the hierarchical build-up of galaxies over cosmic history. The study highlights a bottom-up formation process, where smaller galaxies merge to form larger galaxies. Furthermore, the relationship between galaxy size and star formation rate (SFR) at z > 7 is explored, revealing a trend where smaller and less massive galaxies exhibit higher SFR. This provides crucial insights into models of galaxy formation and evolution, offering a glimpse into the early universe when it was less than one billion years old.

Ventilation requirements for generating (C_Qf) and sustaining (C_Qc) a supercavity are evaluated across a broad range of Froude numbers (Fr) for each cavitator and compared to backward-facing models (BFM). Results indicate that the cone-shaped cavitator requires the least air to generate a supercavity across most flow regimes, except at very high Fr.

"Tensor principal component analysis (PCA) is a pivotal tool for analyzing intricate multi-dimensional data that exhibits multiway structure. Traditional PCA methodologies fall short when handling data structures with nonlinearity, non-Gaussian distribution, or reliance on multiple factors. Tensor PCA extends the conventional linear PCA by conceptualizing data as an order-d tensor, thus accommodating nonlinearity and interactive attributes. Despite its efficacy, the computational complexity of tensor PCA is notable, arising from the curse of dimensionality and the non-convex nature of tensor factorization. In response, a novel technique termed sum-of-squares tensor PCA (SOSTPCA) is introduced in this study, leveraging sum-of-squares (SoS) proofs. SoS serves as an efficient optimization method converting polynomial optimization dilemmas into a series of semidefinite programs (SDPs). Building upon this foundation, SOSTPCA formulates tensor PCA as a non-convex polynomial optimization predicament, securing optimal convergence through an SoS relaxation followed by an SDP. Highlighted advantages of SOSTPCA include global optimality, scalability for high-dimensional tensors of varying size and rank, and robustness against noise, outliers, and missing data. Demonstrated effectiveness across synthetic and real-world datasets, encompassing image analysis and neuroscience data, affirms SOSTPCA's superiority in accuracy, efficiency, and robustness over existing tensor PCA methodologies. Theoretical assurances provided underscore the efficacy and complexity of SOSTPCA, heralding a new era of tensor PCA and polynomial optimization driven by SoS proofs.","Tensor principal component analysis (PCA) is a pivotal tool for analyzing intricate multi-dimensional data that exhibits multiway structure. Traditional PCA methodologies fall short when handling data structures with nonlinearity, non-Gaussian distribution, or reliance on multiple factors. Tensor PCA extends the conventional linear PCA by conceptualizing data as an order-d tensor, thus accommodating nonlinearity and interactive attributes. Despite its efficacy, the computational complexity of tensor PCA is notable, arising from the curse of dimensionality and the non-convex nature of tensor factorization. In response, a novel technique termed sum-of-squares tensor PCA (SOSTPCA) is introduced in this study, leveraging sum-of-squares (SoS) proofs. SoS serves as an efficient optimization method converting polynomial optimization dilemmas into a series of semidefinite programs (SDPs). Building upon this foundation, SOSTPCA formulates tensor PCA as a non-convex polynomial optimization predicament, securing optimal convergence through an SoS relaxation followed by an SDP.

"The research paper investigates the efficacy of the Jordan-Chevalley decomposition in matrix analysis, specifically emphasizing the capability to decompose a square matrix $U$ with coefficients in a field $k$ by representing it as $U=D+N$, where $D$ is a diagonalizable matrix and $N$ is a nilpotent matrix that commutes with $D$. This technique extends to separable elements $u$ in a $k$-algebra $A$, allowing for a unique representation of $u$ as a sum $u=d+n$, where $d$ is absolutely semi-simple and $n$ is nilpotent, both commuting with each other. The decomposition is facilitated by an algorithm, inspired by the Newton method, that accurately determines the absolutely semi-simple part $d$ of $u after a finite number of iterations. The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated through a computation involving a $15 \times 15$ matrix with eigenvalues of multiplicity 3. Additionally, the classical method, based on the Chinese remainder theorem, is explored, presenting the Jordan-Chevalley decomposition as $u=q(u) + [u-q(u)]$, where $q(u)$ is absolutely semi-simple and $u-q(u)$ is nilpotent. This decomposition is obtained by solving a system of congruence equations related to the roots of a polynomial $p \in k[x]$ that satisfies $p(u)=0$. The approach showcases the ability to compute $q$ without the exact knowledge of the roots of $p using an iterative process. Furthermore, the historical significance of naming the decomposition as ""Jordan-Chevalley decomposition"" is justified over the alternative term ""Dunford decomposition"". The paper also discusses multiplicative versions of this decomposition in semi-simple Lie groups, underscoring its relevance in elementary linear algebra courses based on a decade-long teaching experience at an engineering school on the Basque Coast.","The research paper investigates the efficacy of the Jordan-Chevalley decomposition in matrix analysis, specifically emphasizing the capability to decompose a square matrix $U$ with coefficients in a field $k$ by representing it as $U=D+N$, where $D$ is a diagonalizable matrix and $N$ is a nilpotent matrix that commutes with $D$.

"XMM-Newton was utilized to analyze the X-ray properties of the eclipsing magnetic cataclysmic variable 2PBC J0658.0-1746, confirming its classification as a polar system through optical observations. The X-ray emissions displayed distinct brightness patterns, including total eclipses occurring every 2.38 hours, aligning with optical behavior. This discovery establishes 2PBC J0658.0-1746 as the second hard X-ray-selected eclipsing polar within the orbital period gap. The X-ray flux exhibited significant variability over varying timescales, indicating fluctuations in the mass accretion rate. By refining the orbital ephemeris through X-ray eclipses, the binary inclination was constrained between 79 and 90 degrees, with a mass ratio range of 0.18 to 0.40. Notably, the companion mass was estimated at 0.2 to 0.25 solar masses, with a radius of 0.24 to 0.26 solar radii and a spectral type of M4. Additionally, the white dwarf mass was inferred to be at least 0.6 solar masses based on the X-ray spectrum. Constraints on the magnetic colatitude and offset in azimuth suggest a non-stationary mass accretion process with a focus on the main accreting pole. Spectral energy distribution analysis revealed significant excess in the mid-IR due to cyclotron emission. Through detailed multi-wavelength observations and meticulous analysis, 2PBC J0658.0-1746 emerges as a compelling and informative case study within the rare category of hard X-ray eclipsing polars, shedding light on the behaviors and characteristics of magnetic cataclysmic variables within the orbital period gap.","XMM-Newton was utilized to analyze the X-ray properties of the eclipsing magnetic cataclysmic variable 2PBC J0658.0-1746, confirming its classification as a polar system through optical observations.
