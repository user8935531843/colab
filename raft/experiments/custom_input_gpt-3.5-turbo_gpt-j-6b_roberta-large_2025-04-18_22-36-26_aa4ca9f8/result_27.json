    "original": "Through cosmic microwave background measurements, it has been revealed that the temperature of the universe has exhibited virtually no variation over time, presenting the horizon problem. To address this issue, we investigate massless scalar theories of gravity from the Madelung representation perspective. We showcase how the Madelung representation can be harnessed to incorporate quantum gravity effects, thereby laying a foundation for studying gravitational wave propagation. Our numerical simulations corroborate that the Madelung representation aligns with cosmic microwave background observations, indicating its potential as a viable solution to the horizon problem. Delving deeper into the physical implications of our approach, we propose avenues for future exploration, including the extension of our analysis to alternative gravity theories. Our findings present an optimistic trajectory towards comprehending the fundamental nature and evolution of the universe, suggesting a promising avenue for further research endeavors. An experimental design quandary is addressed, focusing on selecting optimal variables $x$ to estimate a function $m(x)$ observed amidst noise. By fitting a linear model to approximate $m(x)$, it is uncovered that the ordinary least squares estimator yields an inconsistent estimation of the best linear approximation, denoted as $\\ell(x). Consequently, weighted least squares is advocated as a superior alternative. Formulating an asymptotic minimax criterion for this estimator emphasizes the importance of a design that minimizes said criterion while emphasizing optimal randomness in the variable selection process. Remarkably, the optimal random minimax design diverges from deterministic counterparts, showcasing enhanced performance, particularly when dealing with quadratic or cubic functions. This study opens up novel insights into optimal design construction, elevating the efficiency of weighted least squares estimators with profound implications across diverse domains like medicine, engineering, and social sciences. Leveraging the Herschel-HIFI instrument, observations of nuclear spin symmetries of amidogen (NH2) in high-mass star-forming regions have been conducted. By scrutinizing the ortho-to-para ratio (OPR) of NH2 through radiative transfer models, insights into the excitation and emission of ground state rotational transitions have been garnered. The discerned OPR values in these regions challenge the thermodynamic equilibrium expectations, offering intriguing glimpses into temperature-dependent astrophysical processes. This study sheds new light on the physical conditions and chemical processes operative in these dynamic astrophysical landscapes, enriching our understanding of high-mass star-forming regions.",
