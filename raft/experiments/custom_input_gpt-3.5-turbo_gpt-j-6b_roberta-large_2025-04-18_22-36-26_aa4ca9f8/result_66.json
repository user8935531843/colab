    "original": "In analyzing Supernovae Ia (SNe Ia) through observations with the UVOT instrument on the Swift satellite, a structured pattern in the UV-OPT color discrepancies of normal SNe has been illuminated. We scrutinize UV-OPT color data from 25 SNe Ia, classifying them into 4 distinct groups, with approximately 1/3 displaying bluer UV-OPT shades compared to the predominant group, known as \"NUV-red\" SNe Ia. These \"NUV-blue\" SNe Ia exhibit a 0.4 mag difference in u-v colors compared to their \"NUV-red\" counterparts. Another subgroup showcases color resemblances to \"NUV-red\" SNe Ia in the u-v to uvw1-v colors but aligns more closely with the \"NUV-blue\" SNe Ia in uvm2-v hues, coined as \"MUV-blue\". A final cluster initially demonstrates similarities to \"NUV-red\" SNe Ia, albeit with more modest color transitions compared to the dominant NUV-red group, denoting the \"irregular\" events. This segment comprises NUV-red events characterized by broad optical peaks, thereby posited as a subset of the NUV-red class. After segregating these groups and accounting for the rapid temporal shift in UV-OPT colors, we observe that the variance in two NUV-OPT colors, u-v & uvw1-v, is consistent with the scatter in b-v colors. This discovery holds significant promise for pushing the boundaries of cosmological applications of SNe Ia into the near-ultraviolet spectrum. By delving into spectrophotometry data of SNe Ia studied using the Hubble Space Telescope, we unveil a fundamental spectral distinction within the 2900-3500A wavelength range, dominated by iron-peak element absorption. NUV-blue SNe Ia showcase reduced NUV absorption in comparison to NUV-red SNe Ia, a revelation indicative of unique spectral features. We observe a common occurrence of unburned carbon evidence in all NUV-blue SNe Ia, as opposed to a solitary NUV-red SN Ia displaying this trait. Beyond this, every NUV-blue event exhibits a low gradient of the SiII 6355A absorption feature, with numerous NUV-red events also exhibiting such characteristics, hinting at potential overlaps between NUV-blue events and the larger LVG group. This study underscores the potential of employing UV to optical color variances in grouping normal SNe Ia, offering a novel and potent toolkit for enhancing our comprehension of these pivotal cosmological occurrences. The integration of UV data into categorization methods holds the promise of minimizing biases in SNe Ia selection and optimizing cosmological measurements' accuracy. Furthermore, this methodology can aid in unveiling the physical attributes of SNe Ia, such as distinct progenitor systems, transitional phases, and environmental variations. The findings of this study underscore the potential for leveraging UV to optical color variances in categorizing normal SNe Ia, a pivotal step towards establishing an accepted classification system for SNe Ia. This trajectory of continuous exploration offers a substantial contribution towards refining cosmological measurements' precision and understanding the universe's intricacies surrounding us.",
