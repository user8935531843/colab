    "original": "The successful delivery of therapeutic agents like small interfering RNA (siRNA) is crucial in cancer treatment, and a novel approach utilizing cationic copolymer-functionalized fluorescent nanodiamonds (CNDs) for siRNA delivery in a xenografted tumor in mice is reported. This involved designing CNDs to achieve subcellular-resolved organ distribution, facilitating enhanced cellular uptake predominantly through clathrin-mediated endocytosis and subsequent endosomal escape. The CNDs demonstrated effective delivery of siRNA to the tumor site, resulting in efficient gene silencing and a significant reduction in tumor growth upon systemic injection of CNDs loaded with siRNA. Furthermore, detailed analysis through confocal fluorescence microscopy and proton imaging highlighted the benefits of subcellular-resolved organ distribution, underscoring the potential of this approach for cancer therapy. The study of the ultraviolet and infrared behavior of 2D topological BF-Theory coupled to vector and scalar fields revealed its equivalence to 2D gravity coupled to topological matter. Through algebraic renormalization techniques, it was demonstrated that this model remains anomaly-free and is both ultraviolet and infrared finite across all orders of perturbation theory. The finiteness properties of 2D topological BF-theory with matter coupling were investigated, illustrating its UV finiteness at one loop and showcasing that all divergences can be absorbed via renormalization of the couplings. The comprehension of this result in the context of the theory's behavior in the infrared limit was also explored. Exploration of worldvolume actions for D-branes coupled to the worldvolume U(1) gauge field and Ramond-Ramond (RR) potentials in nonrelativistic string theory underpins an in-depth analysis. By studying the dual D-brane actions in Nonrelativistic String Theory (NRST), insights into the underlying concepts and physical implications were derived. The noncommutativity of dual D-branes in NRST, rooted in the noncommutativity of the background, was elucidated, shedding new light on their properties and potential applications in various domains of theoretical physics. The detailed study of Bipartite Field Theories (BFTs), a category of 4d N=1 gauge theories governed by bipartite graphs, unfolded new avenues in understanding this class of theories. With the introduction of a new approach for assigning gauge symmetries to graphs, an innovative method for determining the toric Calabi-Yau moduli spaces of BFTs was established. The systematic BFT prescription for graph reductions and the exploration of non-commutative dual D-branes in Eleventh Harmonic String Theory offered significant insights into the algebraic structures and physical observables. The unprecedented Giant Flare event of December 27, 2004, originating from Soft Gamma Repeater (SGR) 1806-20, provided valuable insights into the behavior of magnetars and the mechanisms behind their energy bursts. A detailed analysis of the Giant Flare event using data from multiple observatories unraveled characteristic features, shedding light on the increasing brightness and proposing explanations, such as the magnetic energy release from the star's surface. Moreover, the study explored the distinctive attributes of SGR 1806-20, arising from its rapid rotation and strong magnetic field, setting the stage for further research on SGR behavior and implications in astrophysics.",
