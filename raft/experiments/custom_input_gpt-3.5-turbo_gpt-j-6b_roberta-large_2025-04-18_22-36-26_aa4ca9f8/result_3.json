    "original": "In-depth analysis of high-dispersion spectra centered around the Li 6708 A line has been conducted for 70 potential members of the open cluster NGC 3680, focusing on stars in the turnoff region. A measurable Li abundance was determined for 53 stars, with 39 showing radial velocities and proper motions indicative of cluster membership. Following normalization to common temperature and abundance scales, previous Li estimations were consolidated, resulting in a sample of 49 members, with 40 encompassing the cluster Li-dip. Spectroscopic elemental analysis of 8 giants and 5 turnoff stars indicated [Fe/H] = -0.17 +/- 0.07 (sd) and -0.07 +/- 0.02 (sd), respectively. Synthesizing Ca, Si, and Ni measurements revealed values consistent with scaled-solar ratios. Comparison with Y^2 isochrone models yielded an age of 1.75 +/- 0.10 Gyr and an apparent modulus of (m-M) = 10.30 +/- 0.15 for the cluster, locating the Li-dip center at 1.35 +/- 0.03 solar masses. Notably, 5 out of 9 giant cluster members were found to exhibit measurable Li with A(Li) close to 1.0, contributing to a comprehensive understanding of lithium abundance in NGC 3680. Additionally, a correlational analysis pointed to age-driven lithium depletion in post-main sequence stars, underscoring the impact of stellar evolution on lithium content. This study also offers a comparison of lithium-rich stars in NGC 3680 with other open clusters of similar metallicities, revealing distinct age distributions and shedding light on the depletion mechanisms influencing different stellar populations. The analytical insights from this study offer valuable contributions to our understanding of the evolution of open clusters and the cosmic abundance of lithium. A novel line list has been developed to enhance the parametrization of stellar spectra derived from Gaia-RVS, focusing on the analysis of late-type star spectra. This line list was meticulously designed, incorporating the latest atomic and molecular data, and encompassing approximately 61,000 spectral lines spanning the wavelength range of Gaia-RVS from 845 to 872 nm. Noteworthy refinements were integrated to improve the precision and accuracy of the elemental abundances deduced from Gaia-RVS spectra, coupled with corrections to address departures from local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE). The parametrization methodology was further fine-tuned through a hybrid approach involving spectral synthesis and statistical techniques, resulting in augmented precision in determining critical stellar atmospheric parameters such as effective temperature, surface gravity, and metallicity. Rigorous testing using synthetic spectra validated the efficacy of the GSP-spec line list and the parametrization method, affirming their utility in delivering precise and accurate determinations of stellar atmospheric parameters for stars boasting signal-to-noise ratios exceeding 30. This groundbreaking line list and parametrization framework hold significant potential in advancing large-scale spectroscopic surveys like Gaia, thereby facilitating the comprehensive assessment of the kinematic and chemical properties of over a billion stars in the Milky Way. Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) emerges as a compelling algorithm for sparse recovery, offering robust performance in sparsity reconstruction tasks. With recent advancements shedding light on OMP's exact recovery guarantees for K-sparse signals, strategic analysis of online guarantees for signal recovery with more than K iterations becomes imperative. Presenting a novel framework, this study introduces rigorous online guarantees for recovering K-sparse signals with greater than K OMP iterations, surpassing the conventional K-step recovery bounds. The proposed conditions, tailored to address shortcomings in K-step guarantees, offer unparalleled exact recovery within significantly reduced iterations, positioning OMP as a frontrunner in sparse signal recovery. Leveraging extensive simulations and comparisons with established signal recovery algorithms, the study unveils pivotal insights into OMP's phase transitions and operational dynamics, consolidating its status as a versatile and efficient tool for diverse signal processing applications. These experimental validations underscore OMP's prowess in generating precise and accurate sparse signal recoveries, underscoring its potential to revolutionize signal processing methodologies across varied domains.",
