    "original": "This study outlines a proposal for the development of a cutting-edge inverse-geometry spallation-driven ultracold neutron (UCN) source with a vast array of scientific and technological applications, from fundamental neutron physics to materials science. The proposed source capitalizes on a high-power proton accelerator to induce neutron production via the spallation process, followed by channeling these neutrons into a UCN converter to generate UCNs through extreme cooling. The UCNs are intended for utilization in diverse experiments. The proposed source boasts a high UCN production rate, capable of surpassing existing sources by more than two orders of magnitude, thus enabling the execution of experiments not previously feasible. Another significant advantage of the proposed source is its flexibility; thanks to the inverse-geometry design, easy reconfiguration is possible for diverse experiments. Moreover, the high-energy proton beam utilized in the spallation process can be finely tuned to produce neutrons with specific energies and spectra, broadening the scope of experiment possibilities. The paper elaborates on the conceptual design of the proposed source, encompassing the accelerator, target, UCN converter, and experimental areas while factoring in the scientific requirements and prevailing technological constraints. Furthermore, the ongoing R&D endeavors aimed at developing the various components of the proposed system are discussed. Ultimately, the proposal highlights the potential for a next-generation inverse-geometry spallation-driven ultracold neutron source capable of delivering high UCN production rates and experimental adaptability, poised to significantly progress neutron physics and materials science, with promising prospects for successful implementation. This study delves into dmB, a novel metric disassociated from distance and extinction, aimed at quantifying the contribution of stellar populations exceeding 9 Gyr to the average r-band surface brightness of the bulge component in 135 late-type galaxies (LTGs) sourced from the CALIFA survey with a substantial mass range. The core finding indicates that LTG bulges follow a continuous sequence of heightened dmB corresponding to growing M*T, M*B, stellar mass surface density S*, mass-weighted age, and metallicity, where older, denser, and massive bulges exhibit elevated dmB values. Additionally, an increase in bulge-to-disk age and metallicity disparities, and the bulge-to-disk mass ratio is observed with rising M*T. Notably, high-mass, high-S* bulges exclusively exhibit LINER- and Seyfert-specific emission-line ratios in place of usual star formation (SF) prevalence seen in lower-mass bulges. The coherence in LTG bulge properties and the relative age and metallicity contrasts with parent disks suggest a concurrent evolutionary pathway bestowing continuous physical and developmental attributes. The study aligns with a narrative wherein bulge expansion in LTGs is steered by a blend of rapid-early and gradual-secular processes, wherein the latter gains prominence with increasing M*T. These processes, comprising in situ SF concentrated in the bulge coupled with inward disk material migration, are anticipated to drive non-homologous S* radial expansion paralleled by an amplified Sersic index correlating with growing galaxy mass.",
