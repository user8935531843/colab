    "original": "This research delves into the study of the behavior, spectral properties, and mixing characteristics of cocycles affiliated with compact Lie groups. By examining specific classes of cocycles, we establish a correlation between the absence of singular continuous spectra and the K-property, a form of mixing behavior. Additionally, we identify criteria for the manifestation of K-property in cocycles associated with SO(3) and SU(2), highlighting its role in excluding singular continuous spectra in certain classes of cocycles linked to compact simple Lie groups. Our investigation delves into the convergence of the Lyapunov exponent and the Mather exponent for quasi-periodic cocycles, shedding light on their spectral properties. Moreover, we explore the Hölder continuity of the Kobayashi pseudometric and its variations in associated Mather quotients, demonstrating uniform bounds across different levels of the Mather sets within the phase space. The implications of our findings extend to the study of invariant Gibbs measures in quasi-periodic cocycles, underscoring the importance of K-property in determining the existence of a unique invariant Gibbs measure. This study provides valuable insights into the spectral characteristics of cocycles related to compact Lie groups and their connections to invariant Gibbs measures, paving the way for further advancements in related research areas. In this paper, we present a unified framework for the classification and derivation of common probability distributions based on the principles of information symmetry and measurement scale. By applying the concepts of maximum entropy and minimum information, we demonstrate how different continuous distributions are related through variations in measurement scale. This framework provides a comprehensive understanding of how various distributions, including the normal, exponential, gamma, and beta distributions, can be derived as specific cases of a general class of probability functions. Additionally, we explore the diverse applications and properties of these distributions in fields such as finance, engineering, and physics, shedding light on their versatility and utility. Our study offers a fresh perspective on the fundamental principles of probability theory, laying the groundwork for future research in this area. Leveraging the unique properties of doped graphene nanoislands, this research investigates the potential for enhancing nonlinear optical wave-mixing processes at the nanoscale. By harnessing the plasmonic capabilities of graphene nanostructures, we demonstrate significant improvements in nonlinear signal responses due to localized surface plasmon resonances. Our experimental and theoretical analyses underscore the critical role of geometric parameters in graphene nanostructures in enhancing the nonlinear optical response. Furthermore, we showcase the applicability of this effect in ultrafast all-optical switching and logic operations within nanoscale dimensions. This study provides valuable insights into the underlying mechanisms of plasmon-enhanced nonlinear wave mixing in graphene nanostructures and sets the stage for the development of innovative optoelectronic devices and applications utilizing these materials. This article introduces novel quantitative uniqueness and approximation properties for perturbations of Riesz transforms, shedding light on their boundedness on weighted $L^p$ spaces and their applications in divergence-free signal processing. By leveraging harmonic extensions and quantitative propagation of smallness estimates, we establish improved estimates for truncated Hilbert and Riesz transforms. Our theoretical advancements are supported by numerical simulations, demonstrating the efficacy of our proposed methodologies and enhancing the comprehension of singular integral operators. This research expands on previous works in the field and contributes to the development of robust quantitative invertibility and approximation techniques for truncated Hilbert and Riesz transforms in various applications. By employing the Dyson equation of motion within the Hubbard model, we explore the energy spectra and the weights of one-particle Green functions and off-diagonal Green functions in the system. Our calculations reveal symmetric poles in pairs, validating the findings of prior studies. We introduce a self-consistency requirement for energy spectra and show that our order parameter is based on the first two moments. We delve into the unique properties of the attractive Hubbard model and the impact of certain wave types on the system. Our results provide a comprehensive understanding of the critical phenomena associated with the attractive Hubbard model, shedding light on the potential for superconductivity and advancing our knowledge of strongly interacting systems in condensed matter physics.",
