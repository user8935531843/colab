    "original": "The paper introduces an efficient algorithm for computing the Ramanujan-Deninger gamma function and explores its applications in number theory. The Ramanujan-Deninger gamma function, a generalized form of the classical gamma function, has vast mathematical applications. However, computation of this function is computationally intensive, particularly for large input values. The algorithm proposed leverages modular forms theory and features of Eisenstein series to expedite the computation of the Ramanujan-Deninger gamma function for a broad range of parameters. The algorithm significantly reduces computing time while maintaining high accuracy, enabling extensive analysis of number-theoretic problems. By applying the new algorithm to various number-theoretic challenges, such as computing partial sums for arithmetic functions and evaluating moments of the Riemann zeta function, the researchers gain novel insights into these functions' behaviors. The rapid computation of the Ramanujan-Deninger gamma function paves the way for further research and applications in number theory, laying a strong foundation for future investigations. The development of this algorithm enhances computational efficiency and precision in analyzing mathematical functions, offering valuable insights into their properties and utility in diverse applications.",
