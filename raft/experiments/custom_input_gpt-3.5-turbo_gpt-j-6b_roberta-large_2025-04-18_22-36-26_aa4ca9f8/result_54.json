    "original": "In this investigation, we explore the phenomenon of orbits accumulating towards KAM tori in nearly integrable systems. We present a geometric criterion that extends the well-known Chirikov criterion, focusing on perturbed integrable Hamiltonian systems with regular behavior in the absence of perturbations. Our analysis reveals that the accumulation of orbits towards KAM tori can occur even with minimal perturbations. We conduct numerical simulations to validate the significance of our theoretical findings, shedding new light on the intricate behavior of perturbed integrable systems. Furthermore, we delve into the complexity of a parameterized set cover and label cover, focusing on threshold graphs generated from error-correcting codes. Through mathematical and coding theory tools, we demonstrate the NP-hardness of the parameterized set cover problem on threshold graphs, even for small parameter values. Additionally, we explore the inapproximability of the label cover problem, showcasing challenges in approximating optimization problems on threshold graphs. Our study highlights the intricate interplay between various fields such as mathematics, computer science, and coding theory, emphasizing the fundamental limits of computational problems in diverse contexts. Lastly, we analyze the phenomenon of optical excess in dim isolated neutron stars, attributing it to warm dust in the vicinity of these stars. By examining observational data of five isolated neutron stars, we provide insights into the physical mechanisms behind the optical excess, offering a deeper understanding of these enigmatic objects and their properties. Our study sheds light on the role of warm dust in explaining the optical excess and its implications for the neutron star population and interstellar dust content.",
