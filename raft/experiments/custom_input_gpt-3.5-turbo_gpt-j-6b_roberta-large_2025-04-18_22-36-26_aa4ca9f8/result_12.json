    "original": "The electronic properties of yttrium borides YB$_4$ and YB$_6$ were investigated using $^{11}$B NMR and first-principles calculations. NMR measurements revealed distinct EFG patterns at the boron sites in both compounds, with EFG values and asymmetry parameters corresponding to the crystallographic sites of the boron atoms. The Knight shifts measured by MAS NMR were found to be minimal for both YB$_4$ and YB$_6$. Theoretical calculations, including structural optimizations and EFG computations, showed excellent agreement with experimental data, confirming the accuracy of the structural models. Additionally, band structures, densities of states, and valence-electron densities were analyzed to understand the electronic properties of YB$_4$ and YB$_6. The results indicated that the Fermi level electronic states in both compounds are primarily B $p$ orbitals with some contribution from Y $d$ states, resulting in metallic behavior with weak B-B interactions. These findings not only align with previous experimental observations but also provide valuable insights into the electronic characteristics of yttrium borides. The study sets the stage for the exploration of novel boride materials with unique physical properties, emphasizing the importance of further research on their electronic and magnetic attributes, both bulk and surface, for potential technological advancements. Ultimately, this investigation enhances our comprehension of the electronic structure and bonding in boride materials, offering a foundation for future material design and discovery endeavors.",
