    "original": "We conducted a spectroscopic analysis of late-M, L, and T dwarfs from UKIDSS to investigate peculiar objects and unresolved binaries. Utilizing the YJHK photometry from ULAS and red-optical photometry from SDSS, we selected 262 brown dwarf candidates and followed up on 196 of them using X-shooter on the VLT. The experiments revealed 22 blue L dwarfs, 2 blue T dwarfs, and 2 low gravity M dwarfs, aside from identifying 27 unresolved binary candidates. Further spectral deconvolution was done to determine the spectral type of the potential components. Measuring the equivalent width of absorption features and correlating the spectra with radial velocity standards, we determined the distribution of the sample, centered at -1.7±1.2 km s^-1 with a dispersion of 31.5 km s^-1. We inferred the space density of field brown dwarfs based on our spectral data, with varying densities in the L4-L6.5, L7-T0.5, and T1-T4.5 ranges. An elevated density in the L/T transition suggests a potential higher binary fraction or differential environments for objects within this transition zone, pointing towards varying Initial Mass Functions. This study provides a thorough examination of a significant sample of L and T dwarfs, highlighting peculiar objects, binaries, and estimating space density. In a separate study, we delved into the molecular gas properties of the nuclear regions of six nearby galaxies using high-resolution observations from the VLT's SINFONI instrument. Our two-dimensional distributions of warm molecular and ionized gas unveiled diverse morphologies like bar- and ring-like distributions, varying emission characteristics, and non-coincident gas distributions. Thermal processes were identified as the main excitation mechanism for H2 in the nuclear and circumnuclear regions, irrespective of active nuclei presence. Rescaling of the H2 2.12 microns emission line luminosity provided total molecular gas mass estimates. Large amounts of molecular gas mass were observed in the galaxies' centers, with total masses ranging from 10^5 - 10^8 solar masses. The study also detected a circumnuclear ring in NGC 4536, indicating recent star formation bursts. In a separate study across 27 galaxies, we explored molecular gas morphologies and kinematics in central regions, identifying nuclear disks, bars, spirals, and massive molecular structures. Our findings suggest a correlation between molecular gas fraction and central stellar density, pointing towards gas inflow and star formation regulation mechanisms. The study also uncovered massive molecular structures in several galaxies, providing insights into nuclear starburst events. Through comparisons with simulations, we confirm the observations' alignment with simulated molecular gas properties, shedding light on galaxy evolution and nuclear activities.",
