    "original": "The study proposes a novel integrable hierarchy construction linked to infinite series of Frobenius manifolds adhering to a specific stabilization condition. Investigations focus on these hierarchies in Frobenius manifolds associated with $A_N$, $D_N$, and $B_N$ singularities. Notably, the hierarchy coincides with the KP hierarchy for $A_N$ manifolds, aligns with the BKP hierarchy for $B_N$ manifolds, and represents a reduction of the 2-component BKP hierarchy for $D_N$ manifolds. As a supplementary outcome, the study elucidates the enumerative implications of specific coefficients within $A_N$, $D_N$, and $B_N$ Frobenius potentials. The research delves into examining the integrability aspects pertaining to a class of Frobenius manifolds and the interconnected hierarchies associated with them. A unique method is introduced to create an array of Frobenius manifolds featuring compatible flat connections, based on a geometric interpretation of certain vector fields on projective spaces. The resultant manifold ensemble facilitates a complex network of commutative flows, extending the scope of established integrable hierarchies. The study provides fresh insights into the intricate relationship between algebraic geometry and integrable systems.",
