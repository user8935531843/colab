    "original": "Research on the vibroacoustics of the piano soundboard focuses on modeling the complexity of the soundboard's vibration patterns with minimal parameters. The study, as outlined in Ege et al., aims to predict the behavior of the soundboard using reduced models that effectively capture its frequency response and characteristics under various boundary conditions. By leveraging the Craig-Bampton method to condense finite element models, researchers are able to analyze the soundboard's mobility synthesis and acoustical radiation regime. Furthermore, employing laser Doppler vibrometry for point mobility measurement allows for a deeper understanding of the soundboard's radiation behavior. Numerical simulations using the boundary element method successfully predict the acoustical radiation patterns of the soundboard, highlighting the significance of boundary conditions in determining the radiated sound field. Additionally, the research delves into the interplay between the soundboard and piano strings, demonstrating how their coupling influences the overall sound quality of the piano. By synthesizing reduced models, conducting point mobility measurements, and analyzing acoustical radiation patterns, researchers shed light on the intricate mechanism behind sound production in pianos. The study contributes essential insights for optimizing the design and performance of piano soundboards through a comprehensive examination of their vibroacoustics.",
