    "original": "The k-nearest neighbors algorithm, a widely used technique in classification and regression, presents a simple yet effective approach for time series forecasting. However, the challenges of selecting the optimal number of neighbors and features pose complexities. To address these challenges, two novel methodologies, namely Classical Parameters Tuning and Fast Parameters Tuning in Weighted Nearest Neighbors, are introduced for the forecasting of time series data. The Classical Parameters Tuning method involves a comparison of recent subsequences with historical subsequences of similar lengths to optimize the model's parameters. On the other hand, the Fast Parameters Tuning approach streamlines the search process for neighbors, resulting in reduced computational time. Both methodologies leverage a technique inspired by cross-validation for weighted nearest neighbors to fine-tune the forecasting models. The performance and accuracy of the proposed approaches are evaluated and compared against traditional methods like Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average, Holt-Winters, and Exponential Smoothing State Space Model using real-world datasets such as retail and food services sales in the USA and milk production in the UK. Additionally, robust insights into the implementation and efficiency of the novel methodologies are provided, shedding light on their advantages in time series forecasting tasks.",
