    "original": "Research in diffuse intracluster light (ICL) and cD galaxy halos underscores their close association with galaxy evolution and disruption. A recent kinematic analysis of the ICL within the core of the Hydra I cluster utilized planetary nebulas (PNs) as tracers, revealing intriguing insights into the phenomenon. Employing a multi-slit imaging spectroscopy approach on VLT-UT1, 56 PNs linked to diffuse light were identified in the central region of Hydra I. Observations of these PNs included measurements of their [OIII] magnitudes, sky positions, and line-of-sight velocity distributions (LOSVD), which were juxtaposed against the phase-space distribution of neighboring galaxies. Notably, the observed PNs exhibited a luminosity function consistent with expectations at a distance of ~50 Mpc. The reduced number density of the detected PNs relative to anticipated values suggests potential ram pressure stripping by the hot ICM. The LOSVD histogram of the PNs unveiled a non-Gaussian, multipeaked distribution, with a predominant broad central component and two distinct narrower peaks at 1800 km/s and 5000 km/s. The primary component resonated with the extant intracluster halo of NGC 3311, showcasing congruence in velocities. Conversely, galaxies within the 100 x 100 kpc^2 core region were conspicuously devoid of velocities corresponding to the latter two peaks, implying plausible earlier disruption events nurturing this component. The PNs correlating with the 5000 km/s peak spatially and in velocities align with a group of dwarf galaxies in the MSIS field, signifying a potential connection to ongoing tidal interactions. The partial phase mixing of diffuse light within the Hydra I core hints at continuous intracluster halo development and a dynamically warm cD halo encircling NGC 3311. This study sheds light on the kinematic intricacies and origins of the diffuse stellar light pervading the core of the Hydra I cluster, offering fresh perspectives on the evolutionary dynamics of galaxy clusters.",
