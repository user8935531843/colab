    "original": "Heart rate variability (HRV) analysis is vital in assessing the autonomic nervous system, yielding valuable insights into health conditions. HRV data often exhibit aperiodic non-stationarity, necessitating detrending to mitigate low-frequency influences. Linear detrending minimally impacts global RR data characteristics, preserving SDNN distributions. In contrast, nonlinear detrending alters the complexity and order among different RR data types. Notably, SDNN distinctions between normal sinus rhythm and ventricular premature beats diminish post nonlinear detrending. Consequently, nonlinearly detrended RR data display similar complexity signatures, akin to random signals. While linear detrending remains inconsequential in analysis, nonlinear detrending's impact necessitates caution, demanding complementary techniques to preserve data dynamics. Nonlinear trend removal is crucial for accurate HRV analysis, particularly using EEMD or SSA for effective detrending. Careful evaluation post-trend removal ensures interpretation accuracy in HRV analysis, showcasing its critical role in clinical decision-making. Centrality measures play a pivotal role in quantifying node importance in complex networks. Traditional centrality measures may not capture limited interaction ranges in real-world scenarios. To address this, range-limited centrality measures are introduced, encompassing limited-degree and limited-betweenness centrality. These measures efficiently quantify node importance within specified interaction ranges and adapt effectively to range parameter variations. Experimental evaluations demonstrate the superiority of range-limited centrality measures over standard measures in capturing node importance in range-limited networks. Application of these measures to disease spread and information flow in networks reveals their efficacy in identifying critical nodes facilitating disease dissemination and information transmission. Range-limited centrality measures offer a more precise representation of node influence in networks with limited interaction ranges, enhancing the analysis of complex network dynamics.",
