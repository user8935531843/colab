    "original": "Wolf-Rayet stars are crucial in astrophysics as they signify the final stages of evolution for massive stars. Through an analysis of the mass-luminosity relationship and pulsational attributes of Wolf-Rayet stars, we observe a strong correlation between their masses and luminosities. Additionally, we explore the pulsational characteristics of these stars to gain insights into the physical phenomena occurring within them. Our findings reveal that Wolf-Rayet stars closely adhere to the mass-luminosity relationship, aligning with existing theoretical predictions. Furthermore, we identify a connection between the pulsational properties of Wolf-Rayet stars and their evolutionary stages, showcasing their utility as a diagnostic tool for studying internal structures and mass-loss rates. This research contributes significant insights into the properties and evolution of massive stars, furthering our comprehension of galactic formation and progression.",
