    "original": "Sumo Puff, initially identified as a tidal dwarf galaxy within the M81 group's tidal debris, has been reclassified as a disturbed ultra-diffuse galaxy following a comprehensive analysis of spectral observations gathered from the Keck Low-Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (LRIS) and the Keck Cosmic Web Imager (KCWI) in addition to archival data from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and the Pan-STARRS survey. The imaging data from HST uncovered an elongated, low surface brightness structure with a central concentration, while the KCWI observations highlighted complex kinematics indicative of a recent merger event. The spectrum further revealed a high [N II]/Hα ratio, consistent with a low-metallicity star-forming galaxy, with an estimated star formation rate of ~0.2 Msun/yr. This relatively low rate, in conjunction with the presence of multiple stellar populations and an older age profile, suggests that Sumo Puff has undergone an extended period of subdued star formation. Comparisons with other ultra-diffuse galaxies, particularly those in the Coma cluster, underscore similarities while unexpected positioning within the M81 group's tidal debris raises questions about its origins. Speculations point towards Sumo Puff potentially being a remnant of a satellite galaxy assimilated into the M81 group, further emphasizing the need for continued research into its unique properties and evolutionary history.",
