    "original": "The research paper investigates the efficacy of the Jordan-Chevalley decomposition in matrix analysis, specifically emphasizing the capability to decompose a square matrix $U$ with coefficients in a field $k$ by representing it as $U=D+N$, where $D$ is a diagonalizable matrix and $N$ is a nilpotent matrix that commutes with $D$. This technique extends to separable elements $u$ in a $k$-algebra $A$, allowing for a unique representation of $u$ as a sum $u=d+n$, where $d$ is absolutely semi-simple and $n$ is nilpotent, both commuting with each other. The decomposition is facilitated by an algorithm, inspired by the Newton method, that accurately determines the absolutely semi-simple part $d$ of $u after a finite number of iterations. The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated through a computation involving a $15 \\times 15$ matrix with eigenvalues of multiplicity 3. Additionally, the classical method, based on the Chinese remainder theorem, is explored, presenting the Jordan-Chevalley decomposition as $u=q(u) + [u-q(u)]$, where $q(u)$ is absolutely semi-simple and $u-q(u)$ is nilpotent. This decomposition is obtained by solving a system of congruence equations related to the roots of a polynomial $p \\in k[x]$ that satisfies $p(u)=0$. The approach showcases the ability to compute $q$ without the exact knowledge of the roots of $p using an iterative process. Furthermore, the historical significance of naming the decomposition as \"Jordan-Chevalley decomposition\" is justified over the alternative term \"Dunford decomposition\". The paper also discusses multiplicative versions of this decomposition in semi-simple Lie groups, underscoring its relevance in elementary linear algebra courses based on a decade-long teaching experience at an engineering school on the Basque Coast.",
