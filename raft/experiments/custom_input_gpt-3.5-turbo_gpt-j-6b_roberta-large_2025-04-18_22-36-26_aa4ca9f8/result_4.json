    "original": "This study investigates the generation of 4-dimensional gauge theories and gravity at low energy from 3-dimensional theories at high energy using the fermion condensation mechanism proposed by Arkani-Hamed, Cohen, and Georgi. By multiple copies of 3-dimensional theories, 4-dimensional Einstein gravity is produced in reference to two-form gravity. The 3-dimensional Einstein action without matter coupling being topological, our model exhibits less singular ultraviolet divergences. Introducing matter fermions on a discrete lattice following Wilson, 4-dimensional gauge interactions are accurately derived from 3-dimensional theories, even in left-right asymmetric standard model theories. To achieve this, fermion condensates should generate Higgs fields and gauge fields of the extra dimension. The prospect of generating the 4-dimensional standard model from multiple 3-dimensional counterparts is promising. In addressing the doubling problem in the weak interaction sector, discrete lattices are introduced separately for left- and right-handed sectors, along with the generation of two types of Higgs fields. We explore the interplay between 4-dimensional gauge theory and gravity emanating from 3-dimensional theories at high energy, delving into the dualities between these theories and their implications for understanding fundamental physics. Utilizing tools from holography and quantum field theory, we present evidence for these dualities, underscoring their significance in describing strongly coupled systems. This work offers new insights into the nature of gravity and its relationship with gauge theory, potentially opening new avenues for research in theoretical physics. Additionally, we explore the role of the holographic principle and its connection to spacetime geometry emergence. Our study illuminates the deep connections between seemingly disparate theories, providing a framework for investigating high-energy system behavior and making striking advancements in unifying fundamental forces of nature.",
