    "original": "In hypergraph coloring theory, the minimum number of edges in a non-$2$-colorable $r$-uniform hypergraph has been a classical problem.

This study shifts focus to DP-coloring, a variation of list coloring, to estimate $\\tilde{m}_2(r)$ and $\\tilde{m}^\\ast_2(r)$ for non-$2$-colorable $r$-uniform hypergraphs. The lower bound $\\tilde{m}_2(r) \\geqslant 2^{r-1}$ is proven to be nearly tight, approaching $(1 + o(1))2^{r-1}$. Furthermore, for even $r \\geqslant 2$, it is shown that $\\tilde{m}_2(r) \\geqslant 2^{r-1}+1$, challenging the sharpness of the lower bound. The unresolved question remains whether this result applies to odd $r$ values, yet there is a conjecture suggesting that the difference $\\tilde{m}_2(r) - 2^{r-1}$ can vary significantly.",
