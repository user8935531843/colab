    "original": "This study explores empirical nonlinear least-squares (NLS) methods to address key convergence issues in various fields like machine learning and signal processing. By establishing conditions for achieving optimal convergence rates, the research delves into previously unresolved challenges related to initialization dependency and data noise sensitivity. Combining classical techniques such as the Cramér-Rao bound with recent advancements in optimization theory, the study offers valuable insights into practical scenarios like model fitting and parameter estimation. The theoretical framework developed in this paper will benefit researchers utilizing NLS methods in data analysis across diverse domains. The investigation aims to discern correlations in displacement fields of near-crystalline athermal systems in two dimensions. By analyzing displacement patterns influenced by microscopic disorder types, long-range correlations with size-dependent characteristics are identified. The study reveals how polydispersity and bond disorder generate distinct scaling behaviors in displacement correlations, with variations in symmetry properties based on the underlying disorder mechanisms. Moreover, the paper predicts displacement correlations for soft disks model with two different types of microscopic disorder and verifies the theoretical predictions through numerical simulations. The findings shed light on the complexity of displacement correlations in disordered athermal networks, offering implications for understanding rigidity transitions and jamming phenomena in such systems. Through the analysis of displacement correlations, the study uncovers the underlying physics of disordered mechanical systems, providing a basis for future investigations and potential applications in material design for tailored mechanical properties.",
