    "original": "The search for new fundamental forces in particle physics remains a key focus in contemporary research. By utilizing a high-precision MICROSCOPE experiment, we have established the upper limits of the hypothetical \"X-force.\" Through meticulous measurements of test masses in free fall and comparing empirical data with theoretical predictions, we have constrained the strength of the X-force to be within close proximity to known fundamental forces like gravity and electromagnetism. Our findings offer valuable insights into the nature of the new force and its interplay with existing fundamental forces, aiding in the development of more comprehensive physics theories. Continual exploration of the X-force is essential for deepening our understanding of the universe's underlying dynamics and advancing the realm of physics towards uncharted territories. As the integration of natural language processing (NLP) technologies becomes increasingly prevalent in diverse sectors, it is imperative to address the potential propagation of social biases through these systems. Notable biases have been identified in popular word embeddings, reflecting societal constructs like gender, race, and religion. To extend existing debiasing efforts from word to sentence embeddings, we introduce Sent-Debias, a novel technique that effectively mitigates social biases while preserving the performance of downstream NLP tasks. Our research aims to inspire further endeavors in assessing and rectifying biases embedded in widely-used sentence representations to promote fair and unbiased NLP outcomes. In the realm of particle physics, the evaluation of central black-hole masses within luminous quasars provides critical insights into AGN black-hole masses across varying nuclear luminosities. By combining estimates from quasar black holes with those from Seyfert galaxies, we investigate the correlation between black hole mass and bulge luminosity. Notably, our results indicate a consistent Mblack-Mbulge relation across quasars and Seyfert galaxies, with radio-loud quasars exhibiting significantly larger black-hole masses than their radio-quiet counterparts. Through a comparative analysis with the elliptical galaxy fundamental plane, we derive virial H-beta black hole masses to inform the black-hole vs. bulge mass relation, corroborating our findings with Mblack-sigma correlations. This research offers critical insights into the evolution and activity of black holes in active galaxies, informing theoretical models of accretion and feedback processes. Friction at the mesoscale is a crucial aspect of materials science, characterized by the breaking and formation of local contacts. While traditionally modeled through numerical simulations, we present an alternative approach using a master equation, enabling analytical solutions in certain cases and efficient numerical computations in others. By examining the influence of temperature and contact aging on frictional behavior, we unveil the statistical properties of contacts under different friction scenarios, shedding light on phenomena like stick-slip. Our findings showcase the viability of the master equation framework in unraveling the complexities of mesoscale friction, offering new avenues for exploration and understanding in this critical field of research.",
