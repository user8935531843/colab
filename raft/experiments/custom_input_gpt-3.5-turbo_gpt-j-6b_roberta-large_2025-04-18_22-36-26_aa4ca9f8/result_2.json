    "original": "Kink magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves have been observed in solar atmospheric magnetic structures, potentially contributing to coronal heating and aiding in solar plasma diagnosis. In order to depict the kink MHD wave emission of a coronal loop, we map the kink MHD wave solution of a plasma cylinder onto a semi-torus structure to mimic a curved coronal loop. Through this approach, we identify a quasi-rigid kink motion and a quadrupole term dominating within and outside the flux tube, respectively. The interplay of these terms leads to periodic intensity variations, modulating the integrated intensity and effective loop width. By studying the generated synthetic views of standing kink modes, based on numerical simulations incorporating plasma properties like density, temperature, and magnetic field strength, we gain deeper insights into their spatial and temporal behavior in coronal loops. Additionally, the influence of energy distribution on stability and evolution of these modes is investigated, shedding light on the underlying physical mechanisms driving their dynamics. This research presents novel perspectives on standing kink modes in coronal loops, offering valuable contributions to forward modeling techniques. Dust transport and deposition patterns behind larger boulders on comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko have been observed by the Rosetta mission. Our study introduces a mechanism for dust transport vectors based on a homogenous surface activity model accounting for the topography of the comet. By integrating gravitational effects, gas drag, and Coriolis force, specific dust transfer pathways are derived, channeling dust to near nucleus coma with higher velocities. A global dust-transport map of 67P/C-G is generated through the distribution of dust sources across the cometary surface, aligning with the reported wind-tail directions in the Philae descent area. The prevalence of distinct dust-transport directions on comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko is explored, correlating these patterns with local topography to enhance our understanding of dust dynamics on comets and surface evolution. A novel millimeter wave diagnostic is proposed for measuring local magnetic fields and edge current with minor radius variation in the tokamak pedestal region. By identifying the minimum reflectivity direction at the O-mode cutoff layer, the magnetic field vector at the cutoff layer can be deduced. Full-wave finite-element simulations verify the minimal reflectivity dependance on the magnetic field at the cutoff, confirming its feasibility for diagnostic purposes. Utilizing O-X mode conversion and oblique reflectometry imaging, this anti-radar diagnostic method demonstrates promise for detecting magnetic fields in diverse plasma environments with high accuracy and spatial resolution. The technique's sensitivity to different plasma parameters and experimental conditions, as well as its performance relative to other diagnostic methods, are thoroughly analyzed, showcasing its potential application in magnetic field diagnostics across various plasma physics research realms.",
