    "original": "The study delves into the spectral stability of small-amplitude viscous and relaxation shock profiles through the implementation of Evans function techniques. By reducing the analysis to the scalar Burgers equation, one-dimensional spectral stability of shock profiles is ensured. A companion paper is envisioned to address the multidimensional canonical behavior described by a 2x2 viscous conservation law. A novel Evans function method is introduced to evaluate the spectral stability of small-amplitude shock profiles, enabling precise determination of shock profile stability based on the sign of the Evans function. The approach offers computational advantages over traditional methods, ensuring accurate assessment and high stability of shock waves. The study further extends to a novel biological scenario analogous to collective foraging in animal groups, reflecting the cooperative, central place foraging behaviors observed in ants. The investigation explores competitive search strategies and the impact of limited communication on the efficiency of search processes. By formulating uniform search algorithms, the study showcases the potential for efficient biological scenarios without complete knowledge of the agents' total number, emphasizing the importance of approximating this information. The proposed research represents a unique approach to collaborative search scenarios without utilizing direct communication among searchers, offering insights into enhanced search efficiency and coordination mechanisms influenced by heuristic rules and probabilistic reasoning. The study's implications extend to swarm robotics and autonomous systems, with tangible applications in search and rescue operations and precision agriculture, showcasing innovative solutions to real-world search scenarios. Additionally, the investigation of quantum group deformations in asymptotically AdS spacetimes in three dimensions highlights transformational insights into non-commutative geometries and their physical applications. By classifying possible Lie bialgebra structures and constructing related Hopf algebras, the study underscores the significance of twist deformations in understanding quantum group deformations and their potential physical implications in asymptotic symmetries. The exploration of deformations in $\\Lambda$-BMS symmetry and their action on spacetime boundaries, enriched by loop quantum gravity techniques, broadens our understanding of symmetries in curved spacetime and their implications for gravitational wave propagation and quantum field theories. The study elucidates the distinct features and implications of deformed symmetries in four-dimensional spacetimes, highlighting the transformative nature of $\\Lambda$-BMS transformations and their relevance for theoretical and observational aspects of gravity.",
