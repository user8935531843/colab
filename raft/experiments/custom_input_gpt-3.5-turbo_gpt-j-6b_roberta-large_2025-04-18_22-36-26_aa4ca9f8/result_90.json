    "original": "The study delves into analyzing the sizes of dropout galaxy candidates in the redshift range of z~7-12, utilizing deep images from the UDF12 campaign. With enhanced S/N ratio from the UDF12 imaging, the sizing measurements for known galaxies at z=6.5-8 in the HUDF are significantly improved. By stacking the deep F140W image with existing F125W data, enhanced half-light radii measurements for z-dropouts are obtained. Similarly, stacking this image with the deep UDF12 F160W image provides updated size measurements for a sample of Y-dropouts. A significant milestone enabled by the UDF12 data is the establishment of the first robust galaxy sample in the HUDF at z>8, extending the average galaxy size measurements to higher redshifts. Restricting size measurements to sources now detected at >15sigma, the study reaffirms previous findings regarding the extremely small average half-light radii of z~7-12 galaxies, akin to giant molecular associations in local star-forming galaxies. Additionally, a clear trend of decreasing half-light radius with increasing redshift is noted, with evidence that this trend extends beyond z~8. Modeling the evolution of average half-light radius as a power-law (1+z)^s yields a best-fit index of s=-1.28+/-0.13 over the redshift range z~4-12, aligning with expectations for baryons embedded in constant mass or velocity dark halos. A size-luminosity relationship similar to lower redshift findings is evident in both z- and Y-dropout samples, suggesting a surface density of star formation between 0.05-1.0L*_z. In a revolutionary study, key findings regarding the sizes of galaxies at redshifts 7 < z < 12 are presented using data from the 2012 Hubble Ultra Deep Field Campaign. Leveraging visual inspection and photometric measurements, robust measurements for 212 galaxies confidently detected at z > 7 are reported. A notable decrease in galaxy sizes from z ≃ 12 to z ≃ 7 is observed, supporting the hierarchical build-up of galaxies over cosmic history. The study highlights a bottom-up formation process, where smaller galaxies merge to form larger galaxies. Furthermore, the relationship between galaxy size and star formation rate (SFR) at z > 7 is explored, revealing a trend where smaller and less massive galaxies exhibit higher SFR. This provides crucial insights into models of galaxy formation and evolution, offering a glimpse into the early universe when it was less than one billion years old. The research contributes to unravel the mysteries of the universe's early history, shedding light on a pivotal aspect of astrophysics.",
