    "original": "The study explores anomaly detection in control systems affected by systematic anomalies that mimic genuine inputs, leveraging diverse random sequences to isolate uncontaminated inputs. By analyzing real-time series data and conducting controlled experiments under various contamination scenarios, the method showcases its efficacy in identifying and mitigating systematic anomalies in stationary time series inputs, underscoring its value in systems analysis. The paper details the statistical approach based on the autocorrelation function (ACF) and highlights its applicability in finance and environmental monitoring, emphasizing the significance of addressing systematic anomalies in system analysis. The research delves into the construction of the most comprehensive N=2,4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills gauge theories for any gauge group G in the context of Two Time Physics in 4+2 dimensions, extending prior work on N=1 supersymmetry. The study presents the action, conserved SUSY currents, and off-shell SU(N) covariant SUSY transformation laws for both N=2 and N=4, showcasing the closure of on-shell SUSY transformations within the supergroup SU(2,2$|$N) with N=1,2,4. The theories are formulated in a linear representation of the SU(2,2)=SO(4,2) sub-symmetry on 4+2 dimensional flat spacetime, with all fields, including vectors and spinors, existing in 4+2 dimensions. The additional gauge symmetries and kinematic constraints inherent in 2T field theory ensure a unitary framework by eliminating all ghost modes, enabling a reduction to various shadows in diverse 3+1 dimensional spacetimes through gauge choices and kinematic solutions. These shadows, connected through dualities, correspond to N=1,2,4 supersymmetric massless renormalizable field theories in 3+1 dimensions, showcasing the intricate relationships between the structures in 4+2 spacetime and their counterparts in 3+1 dimensions. The symmetric and comprehensive nature of the new structures in 4+2 spacetime holds promise for facilitating non-perturbative or exact solutions in these theories.",
