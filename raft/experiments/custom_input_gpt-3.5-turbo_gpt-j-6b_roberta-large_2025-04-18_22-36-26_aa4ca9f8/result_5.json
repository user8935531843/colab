    "original": "The study of influential nodes in information networks has significant implications in biology, medicine, and social science domains, aiding in the control of viral spread and rumor propagation in real-world networks. To address limitations in existing methods that rely on local network features and overlook diffusion dynamics, a new randomized sampling algorithm was introduced in this study. The algorithm incorporates both local and global structural network attributes and considers underlying diffusion dynamics and parameters. Through reachability assessments in a set of random graphs, the influentiality of nodes is measured, leveraging a hypergraph for approximation. The proposed method demonstrated superior performance in ranking influential nodes, showcasing a high level of uniqueness and uniformity. The approach's competitive running time, as confirmed by theoretical and practical analyses, adds to its effectiveness in complex network studies. By integrating dynamic-sensitive strategies into the assessment of influential node ranking, this research contributes to a deeper exploration of complex network dynamics.",
