    "original": "Once upon a time, Lucy and her mom were enjoying a hot summer day outdoors. While Lucy's mom was gardening, Lucy was playing with a ball. When the ball got stuck in the back door, Lucy tried to open it but failed. With a strong push, she managed to open the door to reveal a dirty freezer. Shocked, Lucy asked her mom about it, and they decided to clean it together. With hard work, they made the freezer look brand new. In another story, Daddy and Mommy couldn't decide on dinner, so they played a fun game to choose mac and cheese. They both enjoyed the meal and had a happy evening together. In a different tale, Lacy found a fox in her backyard, and they became best friends, going on many adventures together. Lastly, Daisy found a magical crystal, but it led to her being chased out of her house by robbers. Charles and his grandma spent the day adding yarn to make a special scarf, and Ben helped his dad find the perfect log in the swamp.",
