    "original": "Once upon a time, a young girl named Amy had a playful puppy that loved running around the garden. However, when a fence was put up to restrict the puppy's movements, Amy felt the need to find a solution to keep her pet happy. By exploring a nearby park with open spaces and toys, Amy found a way for her puppy to have fun and stay active. Similarly, Minnie, a curious three-year-old, discovered the power of communication through a mysterious message in an old house. Learning about the importance of messages, Minnie shared this lesson with her family, bringing them closer together. In another tale, a driver and his friend worked together to improve a slow car, resulting in a faster and more efficient vehicle. Through these stories, the importance of understanding boundaries, communication, collaboration, and continuous improvement is emphasized, guiding individuals towards safer and more fulfilling experiences.",
