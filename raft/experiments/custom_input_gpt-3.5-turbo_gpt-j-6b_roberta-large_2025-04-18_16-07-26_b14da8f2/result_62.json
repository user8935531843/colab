    "original": "There was a big black bear who cherished the calm and peaceful mornings. One day, he spotted a cute black squirrel and instantly fell in love with her. The bear started following the squirrel through the woods, admiring her beauty. Eventually, the bear and the squirrel became the best of friends, enjoying each other's company and exploring together every morning. The bear felt fortunate to have found a special friend in the squirrel, with both of them adoring the morning sun and fresh air. They would continue their adventures until dusk fell, cherishing the bond they shared. The little girl, feeling relaxed and happy, came into a room filled with unique objects. She spun around, adorned herself with a crown and sparkly dress, feeling like a princess. Marveling at herself in the mirror, she smiled. After returning the dress and crown to the box, she left the room content. Next, a cheerful parade took place, with everyone wearing comfortable clothes and accessories. Balloons, ribbons, and flags added to the festive atmosphere as people happily paraded through town. The event concluded with cheers, hugs, and gratitude, leaving everyone feeling content and joyful. A fun-filled day unfolded for Molly as she found a letter inviting her to lunch with her friends. Delighted, she hurried over and enjoyed a lively meal together, espying the park for a rich jog. When Jack invited Jill to join, she enthusiastically accepted and shared a jog together, exchanging stories and parting happily. Lastly, a father and his charming daughter bonded over making paper flowers, exploring various shapes and creations, instilling a love for crafting together.",
