    "original": "Once upon a time, a little girl named Rachel tried on a coat frame for a special occasion. Her mother fixed the frame so it fit perfectly, and Rachel looked beautiful. The same day, Lizzie's careful car chased a speedy rabbit down a country road, maintaining a modest pace. Eventually, the rabbit hopped into the sunset. Later, Mary discovered a silver necklace in the park, gifted to her by a kind old woman. She cherished it always. Joe realized the beauty of the sky filled with birds, and his mum was proud. Lastly, Lucy and Mary cut a chalk in half, but Lucy learned not to mess with the original. In another story, Amy sought out a painter to decorate her bedroom, and she was delighted with the magical transformation. Each tale had its own lesson or message, leaving a mark on those involved. The End.",
