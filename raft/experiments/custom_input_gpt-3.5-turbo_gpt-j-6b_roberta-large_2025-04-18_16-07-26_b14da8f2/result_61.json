    "original": "Once upon a time, a little girl and her pet pig Stan lived on a farm, taking walks and enjoying each other's company. While on a walk in the forest, they met a kind old man chopping wood, and together, they worked to gather a pile of wood. The little girl, Stan, and the old man bonded over their teamwork and parted ways with grateful smiles. In another scene, a group of excited children played with a football in a vast field, cheering as it soared through the air. Their shared joy and fun united them in the carefree moment. Lastly, two friends, a boy and a girl, learned the power of unity by solving a messy problem in the ground by coming together. Each story emphasized the strength and happiness found in collaboration and teamwork.",
